Andre Hazes,Kleine Jongen,,,"Little boy
You are in this world
So you will have to fight like me

I can know
Life is not easy
There is adversity at every moment

Little boy
There are many good people
But there are bad ones too, unfortunately it is true

You just have to think
That you will soon realize
That honestly takes the longest, believe me

This life is passing
There is so little time, so live because you are free
But do it wisely, make people happy
Then you will be really happy

Because life is so short
Many things change as you get older
You are still playing with blocks, but that will not take long
It's a shame but you don't stay small

Little boy
You will notice at school
It's all about numbers and power

That's life
So learn what to learn
Because then you are the one who laughs last

Little boy
When you grow up later
Then your father may be gone

Then tell
To your own children
The wise lessons from your old gentleman

This life is passing
There is so little time, so live because you are free
But do it wisely, make people happy
Then you will be really happy

Because life is so short
Many things change as you get older
You are still playing with blocks, but that will not take long
It's a shame but you don't stay small

Little boy"
Andre Hazes,De Vlieger,,,"My son's birthday was yesterday
He was eight years old, my dear
He asked me a kite
And he had that too

To his ball, his bike, his trains
No, he did not care about that
Because his kite was everything to him
I just didn't know why

And then the other morning, he said
""Father, are you coming?
The wind that is now favorable
So I'll bring my kite ""

A kite in one hand
In the other a letter
I couldn't understand
But then my son said sweet

I have a letter here for my mother
Which is high in heaven
I tie this letter to my kite
Until she receives him, she whom I miss

And when she reads how much I love her
That I can't get used to that other woman
I have a letter here for my mother
Which is high in heaven

I have a letter here for my mother
Which is high, in heaven
I tie this letter to my kite
Until she receives it, the one I miss

I have a letter here for my mother
Which is high in heaven
I tie this letter to my kite
Until she receives it, the one I miss

And when she reads how much I love her
That I can't get used to that other woman
I have a letter here for my mother
Which is high in heaven"
Andre Hazes,Eenzame Kerst,,,"I sit here all alone, celebrating Christmas
I have finished the punishment I deserved
I stole for our family, but that was no use
Because you are now celebrating Christmas with someone else
How could you forget me so quickly?
Why is there someone else in my chair now?
I am so lonely here, in that cold, cold cell
Can't you really understand what I'm feeling?
Now you are sitting at the Christmas tree with someone else
My children singing ""Silent night""
Yes, it will certainly be quiet to me
With nothing to ease my grief
My fellow humans received a package
With the Christmas wish ""Father, come home soon""
I didn't get mine, that saddens me a lot
Not being welcome in your own home
Maybe I can give my kids some more
What to give from the bottom of my heart
I can't forget, that's why this Christmas song
A song so full of sorrow
No candles will burn here for me
I feel like a Christmas tree without a peak
I feel so alone, where am I going to go anyway?
In my mind I hear Christmas music
I sit here all alone, celebrating Christmas
I have finished the punishment I deserved
I stole for our family, but that was no use
Because you are now celebrating Christmas with someone else
Maybe I can give my kids some more
What to give from the bottom of my heart
I can't forget, that's why this Christmas song
A song so full of sorrow"
Andre Hazes,Zij Gelooft In Mij,,,"[Verse 1]
She was sleeping
I asked her last night
""wait for me""
Maybe I'll be off earlier tonight
She nodded yes
But she knows me (oh yah)
Now I am in front of you
I lingered in the pub again
I never have enough night like that, she knows
How was it?
That's all she asked (what she asked)

[Chorus]
Because she believes in me
She sees a future in both of us
She never asks you make me free
Because she knows, this will pass
I write my own song
Until someone discovers and sees me
That everyone enjoys my songs
She trusts me, she believes in me

[Verse 2]
I would wait
Until the time when everyone recognizes me
And you can be proud of your own guy
In the street they'll say, You're famous (oh yah)
As long as we dream of happiness
That is waiting for us somewhere
Then you will soon forget this night
You trust me, that's my strength
Oh my strength

[Chorus]
Because she believes in me
She sees a future in both of us
She never asks you to make me free
Because she knows, this will pass
I write my own song
Until someone discovers and sees me
That everyone enjoys my songs
She trusts me, she believes in me
(ooohoohhoohooh)"
Andre Hazes,Geef Mij Je Angst,,,"You say, ""I am free"", but you mean, I am so lonely
You feel great, you say, but I am not dreaming
Because those looks in your eyes say everything to me
I feel just like you so you can be honest
You feel very good, you say, your mouth starts to tremble
I think I can help you, but you have to want to
Do each other a service now, that's all I'm asking
Now put that fear away, I already knew: today is my day
Now give me your fear
I give you hope in return
Now give me the night
I'll give you back the morning
As long as I don't lose you
I will find the way with you
Now look at me, no, don't say anything, you can keep quiet
It's still tough now, but I know I can get you
This never has to happen again if you stay with me tonight
Because then you will see when you wake up later that you smile again
Give me the feeling
That I belong again from now on
I'm coming with you
'Cause I'll never let you go now
Now give me your fear
I give you hope in return
Now give me the night
I'll give you back the morning
As long as I don't lose you
I will find the way with you
Give me the feeling
That I belong again from now on
I'm coming with you
'Cause I'll never let you go now
Now give me your fear
I'll give you hope in return
Now give me the night
I'll give you back the morning
As long as I don't lose you
I will find the way with you
With you!
With you!
With you!"
Andre Hazes,Ik Leef Mijn Eigen Leven,,,"[Hook André Hazes]
I look back now, and yet I have no regrets
Those were good years
Because what I did, I never hurt anyone with it
It's my own life
I live my life the way I want to
I don't interfere with anyone else
I live my life the way I want to
Let me go before I change now

[Verse 1 Sam J'taime]
I will take you into the life of a young man
He had to fight without a plan for the future
Don't put any emotions into them doesn't scare anyone
He spent a long time in prison there he became a man
He has been in Amsterdam all night since she was twelve
You were tilted if you got anywhere on the route
He was abused by her mother, has already had to bleed gallons
Happiness was really hard to find, it was not firmly in their shoes
Her father was on the powder, so he didn't really know any better
No more feeling for women, she could not share feelings
Always a burden on them, but he still lives them
Many backs of fines, he had no job so had to steal
Was not really in the books, but was marked with a nine
And said I live my own life, nobody can stop me anymore
Young reckless, the young person still runs into himself
They were tears letters he had written books a sah

[Hook André Hazes]
I live my life the way I want to
I don't interfere with anyone else
I live my life the way I want to
Let me go before I change now

[Verse 2 Sam J'taime]
I will take you into the life of a young woman
A teenage mother who entrusted her heart too soon
But she never gave up, even though she was so broken
Scots dirty by family, so she grew up at a young age
But fell into the wrong hands, had nothing to strive for
She was stubborn it was hard to admit anything
She was on Kinky because she didn't really like to read books
She thought I had no other choice and my child should eat that too
No one was allowed to interfere, she wanted to row alone
Her child was always short of nothing with the latest shoes
Happiness was hard to find, but there is always hope
There is always a choice however your life goes

[Hook André Hazes]
I live my life the way I want to
I don't interfere with anyone else
I live my life the way I want to
Let me go before I change now"
Andre Hazes,Zeg Maar Niets Meer,,,"Don't say anything more
I'll leave if you want
Don't say anything more
Just let me go
Just be quiet now
Refr:
But this is the last time
I know you are looking down on me now
But later when things get better
I hope you are in front of me
Don't say anything more
I'll leave and you're free
Don't say anything more
You weren't mine for months
Refr:
But this is the last time
I know you are looking down on me now
But when things get better later
I hope you are in front of me
And then
I don't see you standing and say
You better go
You said
I'll stay loyal to you
I never believe in you
Refr:
But this is the last time
I know you are looking down on me now
But if it goes better for me later
I hope you are in front of me
But then
I don't see you anymore and say
You better go
You said
I'll stay loyal to you
I never believe in you
Ooooh this is the last time
I know you look down on me
But when things are getting better
I hope you are in front of me
No then I don't see you
And say you better go
You told me I'll stick with you"
Andre Hazes,"Bloed, Zweet en Tranen",,,"[Verse 1]
I did well
But also done so wrong
When I look back
On time
A smile with tears
That's how I feel today
Tasted of life
So many friends unprecedented

[Chorus]
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Fuck this now""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Friends, goodbye friends, the cake is finished""

[Verse 2]
I've known luck
But also known grief
How often
I hit my head
But still I am satisfied
With all that I am
When your fame is over
Look who you still know

[Chorus]
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Fuck this now""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Friends, goodbye friends, the cake is finished""

[Bridge]
I really saw it
No, I'm not hungry
I am not surprised that I will miss someone later
I really stay alone
Yes, really alone
No more nagging at my head, just fuck off now

[Chorus]
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Fuck this now""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Friends, goodbye friends, the cake is finished""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Fuck this now""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Friends, goodbye friends, the cake is finished"""
Andre Hazes,Sorry,,,"Sorry
What I want to say to you is sorry
But you're leaving, it's over
Yes, really over
Really over
Sorry
Yes I have to go
But I say sorry
I know it might be tough
But I'm leaving
It is too late
Silence
It scares me, that great silence
You were so busy, it's over
That is over, yes really over
Only you know what I care about you
I've lived for you
We remain friends
Only you know that I love you
But it's too late, it's over
Stuff
I still have so much of your stuff
May I keep them here with me
Just for me
Just for me
Letters
I still have so many letters from you
I will read them every day
When I see you again
See your again
Only you know what I care about you
I've lived for you
We remain friends
Only you know that I love you
But it's too late, it's over
Only you know what I care about you
I've lived for you
We remain friends
Only you know that I love you
But it's too late, it's over

Andre Hazes,Waar Ben Jij,,,"Lost in a chilly past

With the pain of the present

Since you disappeared

The rain has appeared here

Where are you, where are you

Part of my life

You were so sweet and tender

If I shared love with you

It is now quiet and lonely

I don't think I can handle this

Where are you, where are you

I still have so much to give

Our dreams are over, it's over

Just a memory

This will never work out

I have to forget you

And live on again

But live without you

That hurts

You cannot be replaced

It only scares my heart

The feeling when you held me

Your voice, so softly call my name

Where are you, where are you

You are my life

I can feel the tears burning

Get hysterical with desire

I miss you so much, I can't stand that

Our dreams are over, it's over

Just a memory

This will never work out

I have to forget you

And live on again

But live without you

That hurts"
Andre Hazes,Laat Me Vrij,,,"Turn around
I want to ask you let me go
You look at me
I just want to be yes really free
I don't want anything more
Not for you
It's better this way
No it has been fun
I'll go on without you
It is no longer possible
I do not want anymore
It really doesn't hurt me now
Let me go, let me go
Forget what we've done
Forget me
No no kiss
Before I get out of here
It's that good
I'm not staying here because I have to
It is over
Yes really over
I really don't feel like you anymore
No it has been nice I will continue but without a wife
It is no longer possible
I do not want anymore
It really doesn't hurt me now
Let me go, let me go
Forget what we've done
Forget me
Peace there is the door
Here you have the keys
Leave everything alone
That's for you
It is no longer possible
I do not want anymore
It really doesn't hurt me now
Let me go, let me go
Forget what we've done
Forget me"
Andre Hazes,Ik Ben Daar,,,"I am there

If you really need me

Oooh, I'm there

Do you think I forget you like this

I am there

I will always fight for you

I'm fighting to death for you

I am there wherever you are

I am there

A shadow is now falling over me

But I am there

There will also be lights again

I'm there to thank you for all your love

What you gave me

I am there

I can't live without you my baby

I am there

I really mean that from my heart

I am there

You know, I can't live without you

I'm there, believe me

The day is coming

That you trust me again

Believe me

I am there

I am there

I can't live without you my baby

I am there

I really mean that from my heart

I am there

You know, I can't live without you

I'm there, believe me"
Andre Hazes,Over En Uit,,,"I look at your face
And kiss your eyes closed
We ran out of time in those days
I know your mouth, I know your smile
But you rarely said what you saw
And the night was short for my questions
Did I listen so badly
To the voice of my heart
It was not a game for me
But it was for you

Over and out, it's over
Over and out, it's over
You cheated me without limits
You don't care about me anymore
Over and out, it's over
Over and out, I can't take it anymore
It's gotten to the point where I let you go
Over and out

You put your hand in mine
That moment stays with me
I can still see the tears in your eyes
You walked away from me
You explained to me
Why you had lied to me all this time
I didn't want to believe what they said about you
But I know better now
Go away, you are now free

Over and out, it's over
Over and out, it's over
You cheated me without limits
You don't care about me anymore
Over and out, it's over
Over and out, I can't take it anymore
It's gotten to the point where I let you go

Over and out, it's over
Over and out, it's over
You cheated me without limits
You don't care about me anymore
Over and out, it's over
Over and out, I can't take it anymore
It's gotten to the point where I let you go

Over and out"
Andre Hazes,Zie Ik Jou Maar Even,,,"It is night, it is cold
I'm waiting for you to come home
I look up to your window
There are still no lights on
It's getting colder and chilly
My collar pulled up high
What time are you coming home
I am so cold

I'll just see you
I'm happy with that
Then I'll go home again
Another hour of TV
I'll just see you
Yes, then I have enough
I am happy again
Until tomorrow morning

Yes, I was wrong
This should never have happened
I really feel so stupid
I did not expect this
It happened, so much regret
This can no longer be justified
It's too late, it's over
I'm out in the cold

I'll just see you
I'm happy with that
Then I'll go home again
Another hour of TV
I'll just see you
Yes, then I have enough
I am happy again
Until tomorrow morning

Some drops are now falling
But apparently that is part of it
Oh, how long do I have to wait
Wanna see, this is my moment

I'll just see you
Yes, then I have enough
I am happy again
Until tomorrow morning
Oooh"
Andre Hazes,Laat Mij Zo Leven,,,"You only live in this world once
So I make something of it
I live the way I want
And I'll get what I can get
I won't let myself be told anymore
That is past tense
I do what I want in all honesty

It's about time for myself
I had forgotten that for a moment
It's time for you and me
And everyone should know that
There is only 1 in one life here
That can still touch me
The rest can watch it
I'm going my own way

Let me live like this
Let me do my own thing
Let me live like this
Because that's how I can handle the whole world

Sometimes I do things
Which I should actually leave
But you don't hear me complaining
Because that's how I feel good
I live my own life
Whatever people think of it
It is my own life
Owh I do my own thing

It's about time for myself
I forgot for a moment
It's time for you and me
And everyone should know that
There is only 1 in my life that can still touch me
And the rest can watch it
Because I go my own way

Let me live like this
Let me do my own thing
Let me live like this
Because that's how I can handle the whole world

It's time for myself
Had it forgotten for a while
It's time for you and me
Everyone should know that
There is 1 in one life
That can still touch me
The rest can watch it
Because I go my own way

Let me live like this
Let me do my own thing
Let me live like this
Because that's how I can handle the whole world"
Andre Hazes,Diep In Mijn Hart,,,"It's sad to walk here in the rain
How many times have I walked down this street with you?
You were so young and so shy then
We talked about getting married sooner or later

You said to keep waiting for you
I did too, but you didn't stay true to me

Deep down in my heart
I knew you are too young for me
Deep down in my heart
I knew this will suddenly pass

Deep down in my heart
A voice said, ""This isn't for you anyway
She's too young, she doesn't know anything about loyalty yet
When she goes it will be too late ""

Now you are a woman who laughs at life
You make friends that I unconsciously hate anyway
I will never be able to forgive myself for this
It is now as if love does not exist

I hope you find happiness with that other person
It's my own fault, you can't do anything about this

Deep down in my heart
I knew you are too young for me
Deep down in my heart
I knew this will suddenly pass

Deep down in my heart
A voice said, ""This isn't for you anyway
She's too young, she doesn't know anything about loyalty yet
When she goes it will be too late ""

Deep down in my heart
I knew you are too young for me
Deep down in my heart
I knew this will suddenly pass

Deep down in my heart

She's too young, she doesn't know anything about loyalty yet
When she goes it will be too late """
Andre Hazes,Papa,,,"Here I am and I don't know what to say
And whether he understands it all
Maybe it will be okay later
But later that will take such a while

His little hand takes my hand
Daddy are you leaving us
Because there's a big suitcase down the hall
You might not come back, Mommy said

Chorus:
He squeezes my hand gently
Daddy can I come with you
Then you don't have to miss me
And I am never afraid
Then we are always together with the two of us

There I am, shooting a lump in my throat
I lift him up for the last time
I'm ashamed of my tears because he looks at me
Daddy when will I see you again

Chorus: x2

Then we are always together with the two of us"
Andre Hazes,Ik Hou Van Jou,,,"Why do you leave me so alone now
For the first time I was number 1 tonight
You said ""I love you"" a thousand times
But now
Am I alone again?

Still, I know you're already sorry
Because you don't understand now
That I love you so much
I never want another woman
Yes, I was only thinking about you
I gave you love and loyalty too
You can think what you want, honey
I love you

It won't cost you any effort
Because I am nothing
An expensive Roll's for you
An old bicycle for me
Don't forget what you have been yourself
Why why am I alone again

Yet I feel you already regret because you do not understand now
That I love you so much
I never want another woman
You only gave me what I wanted
All your love and your loyalty
You can think what you want, honey
I love you

Yet I feel you are already sorry
Because you don't understand now
That I love you so much
I never want another woman
You gave me everything I wanted, all your love and your loyalty
You can think what you want, honey
I love you"
Andre Hazes,Zoveel Jaren,,,"Maybe it seemed so easy
To make me stand
But you have problems now
Now I let you go
And don't piss at me
And don't lie to me
I've heard everything
What you did
So many years, so many years wasted
But I never bow to you
We walked hand in hand together
The whole world was ours
Not really important to you
You went your own way anyway
You know, I have a lot of friends
They saw what you did
You played but lost
Yes, you have lost everything now
So many years, so many years wasted
But I never bow to you
I let you go
But you're not done yet
You touched my heart
Yes, that's gonna be your end now, sweetie
So many years, so many years wasted
But I never bow to you
So many years, so many years wasted
But I never bow to you"
Andre Hazes,Ik Ben Weer Terug,,,"I am back again
I have really improved my life
Am back again
I am the winner of a battle that was so tough
I am back again
You don't have to be afraid of me I'm back
I can really take life again, believe me
Just believe me

Ref: 2x
Don't want to live on the street anymore
Wants to be back to normal when things are going
Just try to live with me
Yes then you will experience something
Because I now really know for sure that I am back

It was a struggle
I thought I'll never get out of here but still I won
I am really no longer insecure but what I want
Yes that is you
Because I'm sure you still love me
I can give you everything again now I'm back
Yes really back

Andre Hazes,Opnieuw Beginnen,,,"Yes, the nights are getting longer
I can't sleep anymore
My head is haunted
I'm going crazy now

I would have liked to say so much
But the words did not come
It's so confusing too
I am so sad

Start over
I feel empty, where can I go
The rain is pouring down
Start over
I feel empty, where can I go
It now looks like it is raining
Just for me

Your decision has already been made
But the door is ajar
You must have disappeared
But in my heart you are still here

Where once your pillows were
There is now one more
I can still smell you like that
Good night darling

Start over
I feel empty, where can I go
The rain is pouring down
Start over
I feel empty, where can I go
It now looks like it is raining
Just for me

There is nothing left to share now
Because you don't share your love
Sometimes life is different
Usually it is you who do not see that
Because if you really love someone
Are you blinded?
Because if you really love someone
Are you blinded?

Start over
I feel empty, where can I go
It now looks like it is raining
Just for me"
Andre Hazes,De Glimlach Van Een Kind,,,"You are so wise, a child says
You are so gray, says a child
You are married, that's what a child says
You are old, that's what a child says

Then think yes, one more wrinkle
You're really becoming an old gentleman
But before you think, how should it be
She takes your hand and smiles at you

Refr .:
A child's smile
Makes you realize you are alive
A child's smile
That still has a life ahead of it
That life is worth living
Sometimes with a bit of sadness
But with love, happiness and fun ahead
A child's smile
That plays with a train or a doll
A smile like that makes you happy
No party can beat that
What does it matter if you get older
That doesn't matter anymore
Because you feel happy
Even if you have no money

Refr

Lalala ..."
Andre Hazes,Toe Laat Me,,,"I have nothing to lose
Nothing stands in my way anymore
Believe me
That I don't miss anything
But believe me I know what I'm saying to you

You, you wanted everything
No you never had enough
Yes believe me that is over
I can go into my world now but I can do without you

I can now go wherever I want
Well under clubs and restaurants
Jeans no more said
No thank you, but that hurt
It's for you
Beyond

Wonderful nothing to lose
No false friends in the house
I hope it will always rain from now on
Then the sun shines for me again
Even if I have nothing I am free

LET ME!

Please let me ..."
Andre Hazes,Sterk Wil Ik Zijn,,,"[Intro]
Hey we really have to go, let's go

[Verse 1: Rico]
I'm leaving my home and hearth
My entire possessions, down to my skin and hair
With a covered wagon and horse along ancient canal belts
Below the
Sassenpoort
 through for a chat and a drink
There is market, there is rubbish and I am hungry
So I go to McDonalds or get
Pizza al Tonno
But the sun rises for nothing
My meal is warm
That's why I take it with me and eat it in the park
In the park I see Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny
And that bottle
whiskey malt
 determines the mood here
I take a sip and greet the men and walk on to my hideaway
Where I take Kwak on the couch and shake Sticks

[Verse 2: Sticks]
How is it going?
Sitting on a bench I park
Flashing thoughts raked together
Caricatures cart by with a crate
Or rather a tray of Hollandia is being marketed
You see, tramps are guys who linger
They feel lucy, spaced out with diamonds
They provide that constination
Have seen the light or maybe it's religion madness
Walking down the street talking to himself
Traffic controllers should leave that to skotoe
Walkers and footballers in different stages
Walkman on my head, put it on stop and have a chat

[Verse 3: Rico]
We clap a smartlap from Andre Hazes
Together with my mates in the evening in the full moonlight
Next to the trunk woke up like warm bakers
It is a pity that the
Orphanage park
 is no longer there
Due to renovation
That is why we have to wait until it is ready
But I've been waiting another year
Serving out a sentence for guests in jail
But I'm hanging out on a park bench
And keep an eye on everything as prison guards

[Hook: Bert Vrielink]
I am sitting on a bench on the canal
The streets are flooded, no one is smiling
The wind imagines itself away through the traffic
Swinging by, it swoft, and defense
Sand and leaves, streets run through the city
Hear them whisper, I want to listen but wait

[Bridge: Sticks]
Sitting on a park bench
Completely in a trance people walk by
Visualize
Share my thoughts
Everyone is the same we are equal in rank
The question every day
How do I do my dance
Draw my conclusions
Make music out of it
Share it with you
Sit on that couch

[Verse 5: Rico]
The owner throws balls, the dog after it
A kid falls to the ground and yells for his mom
Joggers at the pace of the elderly
Jog the shell-strewn paths
A young couple is sewing in the grass
I can guess;
The park is a paradise on earth
Both with hangovers and we talk about tracks
Ask for a snuff and pick semi-heavy shag

[Verse 6: Sticks]
We experienced everything in this place
I watched my life from under my worn-out cap
I wrote my rules
Usually at this spot
We didn't buy anything we put it in our training jacket
And everyone has tricks like that when they're young
Bad boys can arrange it in a few seconds
I hung out with skaters with traytjes of lager
Breakers at parties and meat on the grill

[Bridge: Sticks]
Sitting on a park bench
Completely in a trance people walk by
Visualize
Share my thoughts
Everyone is the same we are equal in rank
The question every day
How do I do my dance
Draw my conclusion
Make music out of it
Share it with you
Sit on that couch"
Andre Hazes,Zo Heb Ik Het Nooit Bedoeld,,,"A moat, a door
And behind that door there I had to be
I knew you were there
But I began to fear the worst
Because you weren't alone
His image went through me
Yes, now I know why you disappeared so quickly
I never meant it that way
No, I never felt that way
No, I didn't expect it that way
Another in your house who shares with you all night
I never meant it that way
No, I never felt that way
No, I didn't expect it that way
I beg you send him away, I want to be with you all night
I'm listening at your door
And know he's drinking my whiskey
And you, you drink wine
You thought that was so pleasant with the sound
But you said that to me
Oh, is that over now?
Tonight there is another one by your side
I never meant it that way
No, I never felt that way
No, I didn't expect it that way
Another in your house who shares with you all night
I never meant it that way
No, I never felt that way
No, I didn't expect it that way
I beg you send him away, I want to be with you all night
I never meant it like that (oh, like that)
No, I never felt like that (No, no, like this)
No, I didn't expect it that way
I beg you send him away, I want to be with you all night
I never meant it that way
No, I never felt that way
No, I didn't expect it that way
Another in your house who shares with you all night
Oh, like that, I never meant it that way"
Andre Hazes,Zonder Jou,,,"I've been sitting here for hours now
I look out on the street through the window
I know you're not coming, but I have hope
It's raining and the drops
I count them on my window
I don't get very far because I keep hearing your name
It's cold without you
But I still remain faithful to you
I don't have to tell you I love you
If you look in my eyes that says enough
Do I keep telling you, ""Honey, I love you""
I gave you everything you asked me to
It is quiet alone in the house
Please come home anyway
I don't have to tell you I love you
If you look into my eyes that says enough
Night has fallen
The lights are already on
It has already been a long night for me
How long will this take?
My windows fogging up
I slowly write your name with my finger
It's cold without you
But I still remain faithful to you
I don't have to tell you I love it
If you look in my eyes that says enough
Do I keep telling you, ""Honey, I love you""
I gave you everything you asked me to
It is quiet alone in the house
Please come home anyway
I don't have to tell you I love you
If you look into my eyes that says enough"
Andre Hazes,Minuten Duren Uren,,,"Sometimes I imagine
That I hear you talk
What was on your mind
You could just leave me
Suddenly you were gone
Yes without a word
I thought you were fine
I've never heard anything
But dark clouds
They gather
And I look outside
See your face in the windows
Minutes seem like hours
Days seem like weeks
Why are you for the charms
The other one succumbed
No I will never forget you
My thoughts are with you
Yet you left me alone
I who still love so much
Days and nights
They fly by
When I look at your picture
Are you so close to me
No you are very deep
Hidden deep within me
And when you come back
I will always take care of you
We are both silent
We do not have to talk
I hold you tight
Never to let go of you
Minutes seem like hours
Days seem like weeks
Why are you for the charms
The other one succumbed
No I will never forget you
My thoughts are with you
Yet you left me alone
I still love you so much
My life still has meaning
New opportunity, new beginning
Won't blame you
Don't be afraid of that
Those days without you
They last way too long
Because you are the one after all
What I long for so much
Minutes seem like hours
Days seem like weeks
Why are you for the charms
The other one succumbed
No I will never forget you
My thoughts are with you
Yet you left me alone
I who still love you so much
Oh love you
..."
Andre Hazes,Geef Mij Een Teken,,,"You sit next to me you are silent
Your hands cold in the room
Why don't you tell me
Where the pain is your sorrow
You're not talking to me
Looks past me passes me by
While we shared everything side by side together
Chorus: 2x
Give me a sign let me know what you feel
Maybe I can understand what you really mean
Then I know I can stay
Or must get out of your heart
Now tell me what I can do for you
I remember the day
That you were here next to me for the first time
You said to me then
Feel happy and so free
Your hands through my hair
It was so beautiful you seemed so happy
But now you sit cold and quiet here next to me
Chorus: 2x
Free me from my pain
This may not be true nooooo
Then I know I can stay
Or must get out of your heart
Now tell me what I can do for you
Well tell me now tell me what I can do
It doesn't have to be over, does it?"
Frans Duijts,Hij Is Niet Goed Voor Jou,,,"I've been dreaming for years
That this would ever come true
Am so in love again
(he's so in love yeah)

My blood starts to flow faster
You are like in my dreams
I'm feeling good
I'm excited
Nothing is too crazy for me
I'm off again
And I hear a nice melody
For you baby I get on my knee

Together on the beach
Walk through the sand
No one will ever separate us again
Enjoy the sun
On the horizon
Our love that will last
If only time stood still, that's what I want
I want to experience this every year
What fun we have
Nothing is too fond of us
You are what I live for

I take you in my arms
I'll warm you hard
Can't live without you (can't live without you anymore)
You are my senorita
We drink magaritha
Yes you are mine (he is for you yes)
We are in a very distant country
And watch the light
From the moon across the ocean
I want to continue with you

Together on the beach
Walk through the sand
No one will ever separate us again
Enjoy the sun
On the horizon
Our love that will last
If only time stood still, that's what I want
I want to experience this every year
What fun we have
Nothing is too fond of us
You are what I live for

Together on the beach
Walk through the sand
No one will ever separate us again
Enjoy the sun
On the horizon
Our love that will last
If only time stood still, that's what I want
I want to experience this every year
What fun we have
Nothing is too fond of us
You are what I live for

If only time stood still oooooooo
You are what I live for"
Frans Duijts,Ze Hield Eerst Van Mij,,,
Frans Duijts,Ik Mis Je,,,"The last café is closed
Walk through the rain in the neon light
The moon is climbing, the asphalt is shining
See your face
What have I done to you
How could I just let you down
I let go of your hand, was loose from God
And I left
I miss you the smile in your eyes
I miss you. Can't believe it
I miss you I miss you day and night
I'm going to a dating site
She looks like you, you were my wife
I never wanted to lose you
I'm not getting out of bed
No daylight, TV or city noise
No more shaving, clean clothes
I don't care anymore
I miss you the smile in your eyes
I miss you. Can't believe it
I miss you I miss you day and night
I miss you I miss you
I miss you day and night
I miss you the warmth around me
I miss you I can't do it alone
I miss you I miss you day and night"
Frans Duijts,Zeven Dagen Zonder Jou,,,"[Verse 1: Excellent]
Deze sessie wordt een tien voor de meesterbrein
Negen hier, inclusief, een keer cypher
Dat zijn tien 101's voor mij
MC's claimen, maar geloven niet dat ze beter zijn
Verliezen de race, ze zien me niet eens
Ik vlieg ze meteen voorbij
Ik geef een show en het publiek is meteen weer blij
Met iets dat je geeft aan mij freestyle ik heel de tijd
Toch zeggen haters ""het zijn niets dan geschreven lines
Hij is niet eens zo nice
Ik heb een vriend die nog beter rijmt""
Maar het doet me niets, nee
Niet eens een beetje pijn
Ik zie het als bewezen feit
Ben zieker dan de meesten zijn
Je bent een G?
Nigga please
Ga meteen opzij
Ik zie de toekomst
En zover ik zie, ben je verleden tijd
Niets in de game bereikt
Wie heeft je tapes gedraaid?
Je beats zijn wel een beetje nice
Dus die gaan naar deze guy
Je meid die is een heks
Je bent verliefd op dat lelijk wijf
En zij is gek op jou
Sinds je precies op een bezem lijkt
ZJ is de team, die maar bezig blijft
Nummer 1 positie in vizier
Daarop aimen wij
Tiende keer bij 101
MC's worden meteen gesliced
Steeds als ze me zien
Heeft de scene nog een probleem erbij
Nog een sessie
Bang 'm tot je buren klagen
Ben hier zo vaak
Straks moet ik helpen met de huur betalen
Yeah, en is de studio m'n postadres
Bezorg m'n raps
En nee, er is geen megasessie zonder Ex
Je weet wat ik altijd doe
Breek en verneder je fucking crew
Met een regel verbrand ik dudes
Doe meteen weer wat vlees voor de barbecue
Yeah, want als Ex spit en tracks ript
Veranderd een rapper als ik je hele rapclip in spareribs
Zonder saus, nigga

[Verse 2: RQS]
(Hydroboys in da building!)
Bitch ik ben de nicest
Bars zijn priceless
Klapte al die cyphers
Al die niggas zijn timeless
Jullie zijn voor effetjes
Ben niet met die spelletjes
Geef de boys een belletje
We rennen voor die velletjes
Shows door heel Nederland
Die rappers zijn niet relevant
Rotjoch heeft de meesterplan
We winnen hier aan deze kant
Zeg iets, besef iets
Tv op je netvlies
Ma nigga, tag iets
Alles is hectisch
Vlak dit, hot shit
Boy, you know I got this
Zeg me wat is wat bitch
Lookin' like a schatkist, inderdaad
En ik zet stempels sinds de tijden van strippenkaart
Fuck al die niggers daar
Ik chap rappers net een broodje met pindakaas
Wil m'n money lang net de baard van Sinterklaas
Tryna be rich forever
Jullie zijn rich forever
Blowin' money fast
Big Meech, Money Mitch forever
Daarna weer boeng skeer
Never nooit loot meer
Je dacht je was hoodrich
Nu ben je hoodskeer
Hah, dus pak je money nigga
Dit is RQS en shoutout naar Donny nigga

[Verse 3: Jebroer]
Geen tuintje in m'n hart
Ook niet van plan om eentje aan te leggen
Ben een lul, van plan om die ook in je ma te zetten
'k Zie mezelf en denk hoe kan je daar geen haat voor hebben
Net onbetaalde sponsors, niet van plan iets van je aan te trekken
Ben een baller, jij een ballerina
Wil van m'n flat direct naar een dikke kankervilla
Plus vakantiehuis aan de kust op de Maladiven
Kort gezegd, fuck rap, ik wil geld net Justin Bieber
Bieber, Bieber, Belieber
Jij bent echter dan echt niet
I get floes, jij get niets
Jullie draaien verlies
Ik heb money op m'n netvlies
Toeren in een limo
Mucho dinero
Omdat ik lijk op niemand heb ik hoeren op m'n piemel
Maandsalaris om m'n nek en pols
Rook een boom en brag en boast
Omringd door animals
Fly als een taart, ik ben op cake
Jij bent hier niet gewild
Als Geert Wilders in een moskee
Oké, sta bekend om domme dingen
Draai de wereld op m'n vinger
Hoef niet veel te doen om jullie vriendinnen op te winden
Al m'n stunts doe ik zelf
Fack mij, ik voel mezelf
Die rappers noemen zich pimp
Ik kan wel zien dat jij met hoeren werkt
Maak fun of ga huilend dood
Ken m'n teksten uit je hoofd
Foto's als ik buiten loopt
Niet Jezus, maar Jebroer
Beste hang me aan een kruis of zo
Rotjoch, 101Barz ik voel me thuis enzo

[Verse 4: Emms]
Ze zeggen ik ben de beste
Nee, ik heb de beste bende
MS-13
Mella heeft een zoontje
Maar ik geloof het echt niet
DaDa, HBO2
Shaf heeft z'n diploma al
En m'n moeder ziet zoveel meisjes
Ze denkt dat ze oma wordt
Babs zoekt een nieuwe club
Yaël doet mee met Jong Sparta
Jerr gaat weer naar school
Hij houdt zich aan de afspraak
Fack toen, ik wil weten hoe je nu leeft
Want Jerra heeft gestreden
Voor wat ie nu heeft

[Verse 5: Emms]
Ik wil een weekendje weg
Ik wil een weekendje weg
Ik wil een weekendje weg
Ver weg van de stress
Er tussen uit en
Het maakt niet uit waarnaartoe
Er tussen uit en
Want het gaat niet zo goed
Walibi, CenterParks
'k wil weg want ik werk te hard
Brussel, Berlijn
Wil een weekendje ver zijn
Walibi, CenterParks
'k wil weg want ik werk te hard
Brussel, Berlijn
Wil een weekendje ver zijn
Een weekend Emms-chilled
Afgesproken met een chick
Maar ik zeg dat ik ziek ben
Camperen in Zevenbergen
Of klimmen met z'n achten op zeven bergen

[Verse 5: Keizer]
(Natte oksels)
Vraag, antwoord is d'r al
Pries, klik-klak beng, killed 'em all
Doe geen moeite, no sweat nigga
No, never, ik hou het veels te kalm
Keiz, oorzaak als stilte valt
Wie de fack klaart het meeste
De reden dat geen van die mannen willen hangen met die nigga
Gooi die rappers en ik eet ze op
Mic-check, one two, beat is klaar
Sang, Keiz, Priester daar
We eten beats
We geven niets om negers
Die reden zien voor zomaar haat
Zeg ""fack meeste rappers in de game vandaag""
Paps, ze kent nog steeds m'n plaat
Ook al was het de omgekeerde wereld
Was R-E-Z-I-E-K de baas
Geef me die beat en ik pak hem en mishandel hem
Die mannen willen haten, maar zijn down met m'n shit
Kunnen er niet tegen dat we rollen
En ze weten dondersgoed dat al die beats worden gekauwt in die shit
Als er iemand is die blijven me vertellen, vertellen
Ik kan het wel hebben, die mannen willen never komen battlen
Ik settle het direct met je bek
Jullie kunnen blijven zoeken, maar die nigga maakt geen fout in die shit
Mic-check, one two, beat is klaar
Sang, Keiz, Priester daar
We eten beats
Ze geven niets om negers die reden zien voor zomaar haat
'k zeg mic-check, one two, beat is klaar
Fack meeste rappers in de game vandaag
Rest in peace, any beat, Takayna ras
Vijfentwintig jaar
Succes is wat ik zoek
'k had liever kennis van de straat
Dan dat ik las uit een boek
Ik heb nooit gelooft in geschreven regels
Geloofde niet in baan of diploma hebben
Zodat je dan pas kan leven
Want weetje, voor je't weet is't over
Kan je niet laag meer liggen in een huis, alleen boven
En het kan zijn dat je me ziet als een uitslover
Maar ik geniet van m'n life
Voordat het over, is
En ik ben ready voor kaars om te doven
Maar de haat en de woede tegenover me
Zorgen ervoor dat ik niet eens wil dromen, meer
Dus ik doe wat ik wil en ik vind wat ik zoek
Voor de rest ben ik chill
Ben op andere koek en de money die ik maak
Zet de money in m'n broek
Fack wat jij denkt, ik leef good
Maar soms slechte dingen
Omdat hood het bekijkt, lijk het alsof alleen de slechte winnen
Ik leef echte dingen, fuck je normen en waarden
Morgen kan het klaar zijn
En dan? Nigga
Ha? En dan?

[Verse 6: Dret]
Yeah, doe het!
Chillen in mn b-boy stance
Met de joint in mn bek, en m'n dick in m'n hand
Ik geef geen fock on mn bitch, V.L.T. is mn gang
Was een hele korte beschrijving, wat voor nigger ik ben, dus trap
Pet zo laag, zie m'n focking ogen niet
Te vinden in de Tweede Kamer, maar heb niks met politiek
Noem me ladiesman, kijk die chicks die smilen voor me
D'r mattie die heeft swag, bodiesman, cuz I'm stylin' on em'
Rebout-about-it, from night till mornin', ain't no limits
Fuck de crowd op totdat ik gone ben
Fill wat bij van die Hennessy
Voel me net als Tupac, baby when we 
Ride on our enemies
 yeah
Ik ben all about the fockery
Nigga trap de jonko, beats
Parias is het wonderteam
Zie me op die matta, zovan wie gaan we  kantelen
Nigga's zeggen mij ""tranquilo"" dip, maar ik ben meer van het handelen, handelen
Arriba! Arriba!, ey mamacita, laat me je neuken totdat ik boss in je face net als een pipa
Nog 'n keer, de tweede was voor de zekerheid
V, L, for the focking T, for my never verleden tijd
Mijn nigga's zijn op die ""get rich, or die trying""
Jouw nigga's zijn op die ""get stiff, en blijf dying""
Nothing like what I am, 
Eye of the Tiger
, hole of a lion
Ik ben heel op Kay, je kan me vinden in [?]
Zovan ganja bless, waar je 't wil, kan je het brengen
Broer ik hou contest, kom dan, wat wordt het, straatshit, zeg op dan, niggers eten hier wat de pot schaft
Fock around met de verkeerde nigger, en opeens gaat de guns af zovan (doe doe doe het)
Woorden komen aan net als bullets
If you afraid to blast, then you ain't supposed to pull it
Zoek je je money fast, moet je grinden to the fullest
Maar fake je met je ass, ben je automatisch doelwit
Zovan uit focksakkeling, check je pocket, nak je ketting, nigga neem dan zelf je patta's mee
Met oldskool Bijlmerdingen
Fock the world, dat moet dik pijn doen
Ben al sweet en Su als zij moet
Ik ben ziek als kankercellen, laat me dat vertellen, nee kap je seller
Fankawn

[Verse 7: Matarr]
Maar m'n hood die heeft motherfucking hoofdpijn
Maar m'n hood die heeft hoofdpijn
En m'n leven kan niet zo zijn
En mama kan niet broke zijn
Dus, we doen die dingen tot we dood zijn
Maar m'n hood die heeft hoofdpijn
En m'n leven kan niet zo zijn
En mama kan niet broke zijn
Dus we doen die dingen tot we dood zijn
Maar houd je pipa in je binnenzak
Voor de beef in de binnenstad
Voor de boy waardoor je binnen zat
Laat hem lijden voor de tijden waar je binnen zat
En cocaine in de klerenkast
Maar je ziet het pas, als jij die kleren wast
En nu wilt ie als de lauwste rappen
Maar z'n homie in de hood kan zich nauwelijks redden
Paarse biljetten, wat praat je met me
Ik kom de straten op de kaarten zetten
Je moet niet opeens over Delft op de straten rappen
Jij kan beter fucking wapens daar gaan klaar zetten
Homie in de hood, praat een beetje Frans
Nu is 'ie alweer bezig met z'n tweede klant
Love, je doet het goed, maar we leven dat
Doe ze maar de fucking groeten van de Les Pays-Bas
En dat is Nederland, 0031
Je moet je talen kennen en een beetje slangen
Je zet ze aan het denken, ik zet ze aan het werk
Ik zeg ze ""eerst verdienen en daarna rappen""
Maar m'n hood die heeft hoofdpijn
En m'n leven kan niet zo zijn
En mama kan niet broke zijn
Ze vragen waar de straten waren
Nou die zijn er
Ik moet veel passen als een designer
Ik moet veel wassen en zeg m'n nigga Aik' stuur je brada ook en doe het tegelijk
Cocaine maakte je dromen waar
Ik denk erover na, ik ben voorlopig daar
Waar het altijd schijnt ook al regent het
En heb je dingen aan je hoofd, homie regel het
Ik zeg hem ""het komt goed"", maar hij gelooft me niet
Maar de dingen die je ziet, die heb ik ook gezien
Soms is het minder en verkoop je niets
Dus zorg dat je spaart voordat je naar de club gaat
Heb je een vriendin, nou beloof er iets
Dat als je voor de dokoe kiest, dat je nooit verliest
En dat je van je moeder houdt, zij is je nummer één
Verder geen probleem, wij vinden alles goed
Maar m'n hood die heeft hoofdpijn
En m'n leven kan niet zo zijn
En mama kan niet broke zijn
Dus we doen die dingen tot we dood zijn
Maar m'n hood die heeft hoofdpijn
En m'n leven kan niet zo zijn
En mama kan niet broke zijn
Dus we doen die dingen tot we dood zijn

[Verse 8: Lil Kleine]
If I ain't rappin', I'll be trappin'
Als ik niet trap, dan ben ik aan het pimpen
Ik heb schijt aan wat ze van me vinden
En me pooierhand, die doet dingen
Ik heb een Grijze Gans in m'n glas
Ik heb een rode kreeft op m'n bord
Ik heb Swarovski om m'n nek, en een groene jonko in m'n mond
En in de avond draai ik Tante Lien, in de ochtend draai ik Hazes
Vergeet de tijd en gooi je klokje weg, want ik weet niet wat het woordje laat is
Omdat ik hele nachten doorga, van de club, naar de studio
Fock je liefdes, leef je huis boompje beestje, bitch ik ben geen cupido
Ben je stupido? Omdat ik nu iets flow, wil je all upon m'n pik
En de auto so Duits, en de houding so Joods, en suck ma dick
Krijg toch allemaal de klere, swag, en val toch allemaal dood
En je meisje geeft hoofd, Lil' Kleine wordt groot, en het is zo sterk als je ruikt wat ik rook
Ik ging van tosti, naar kaviaar, ik ging van bier naar champagne
Van shows in Marbush, naar shows in het landje
Ik ben niet raar gap, ik ben een wonderkind, misschien kan ik beter leven zonder kind
Want als er zoveel op te focken is, in een wereld waar niks zeker voor morgen is
Zeg ik je mama, wacht pak je rust, want mama, wat als het lukt?
Maak ik je trots en laat je me los
En ben ik effe weg maar kom ik weer terug
En ik vul m'n keel met gif, en ik neem je mee
Ik heb een éénpersoonsbed, nog steeds voor twee
Al die dames willen nog steeds wel mee, maar aan het eind voel ik me nog steeds alleen
En is je schoen geen Nike? That's the shit I don't like
Ik ga focking lekker elke dag, and I ain't going back to my old life
Wat we dragen dat is Nike, in deze tijd maak ik geen grappen
Gooi je sponsor op je body, elke dag een nieuwe patta
Maar nog steeds represent ik Patta
M'n gappie G ja ik zie je, ik was met SLBMG en ik leerde meteen om te skiën
Dus nu style ik op de piste
Ik pak een zwarte of een rooie
Met een lawine op je hielen naar het ziekenhuis, of van Friso iets, dooien
En ik zeg: ""Krijg toch allemaal de klere, swag, en val toch allemaal dood gappie, want ik heb geen zin om braaf te leren, want Lil' Kleine eindigt toch wel in de goot, gappie, swag. Krijg toch allemaal de klere, en val toch allemaal dood gappie, swag, ik heb geen zin om braaf te leren, want Lil' Kleine eindigt toch wel in de goot, gappie.""

[Verse 9: D-Double]
Motherfocker ik ben van Bankjes
In the kitchen, broenu mixen met gasmaskers
Geen TopNotch, team winning CamCam
En ik ben met Rotjoch, op euro's of op Ben Frank's
Wat hoor je als de Glock popt, bang bang!
Kom laat de nigger op een Spongebob Squareddance
Ik heb een dom wijf die m'n cock zuigt
In de spotlight, Limp Bizkit, ik rock mics
Je bitch wilt dat ik 'r in d'r kont naai
Ik stop 'm in d'r mond, want daar komt de meeste stront uit
Ik wil een Catwoman, Halle Berry, sexy taggy, so fine, net Franny from ""the Nanny""
I kill it, pak buit, op mn white net berry
En ik trek de dessy make a nigga duck like Daffy
Bitches net clannies, blijven bellie op mn tellie
Superman, Bollatelli, good fella, Joe Pesci
Hoe ik neuk is scary, very ordinary drerrie, strawberry is de smaak van die spelly op d'r belly, uh!
B-Block, the Empire, in de kitchen, flip die white girl, Lizzie McGuire
B-Block, the Empire, in de kitchen, flip die white girl, Lizzie McGuire
Motherfocker ben van WWP, twee maanden in de game
Tweede keer bij 101
Motherfocker ben van WWP, twee maanden in de game
Tweede keer bij 101

[Verse 10: Kleine Viezerik]
Fawaka, fawaka, fawaka, fawaka, fawaka
Nu is niemand meer down, de money is niet meer blacka
Schatje laat me niet lachen, al die mannen zijn grappig
We doen eigenlijk geen moer en maken flappen, maar het gaat nu over goede muziek
Ik hoor niets
Zoveel mc's, allemaal zo G, allemaal zo vies
Alles nieuw, check de steez terwijl ik rijm op deze beat
Al een tijdje in de scene, de beweging is uniek
Samen een sterker regime, ik heb liefde voor m'n team
Rook een dikke in een dikkere Benz met twee freaks, maar ze doen een beetje stiff, dus ik zeg ze ""dit is Amsterdam baby, doe iets""
2.5 valt op milli Zuid
Voorlopig focken ze met mij, kan een neger leven?
Ik ben gewoon gezegend
Men zegt "" 't leven is een test"", dus waarschijnlijk scoor ik een zeven
Bijna geen hart in m'n ribbenkast
Jullie mogen heel de rapgame hebben, agh
Ik had dromen over shows in de ArenA
Nu denk ik alleen aan, money en m'n kids man
Hou m'n tijd aan, hou de deur open voor de volgende
Volg me, volg me, iedereen moet volgen
Soms voel ik me als 2Pac
Heb money in m'n handen, heb meer dan een ander
Maar ik zal nooit veranderen

[Verse 11: Lastpac]
TRANSCRIPTING!

[Verse 12: Rotjoch]
Get money, get stacks
Pak het hier, pak het daar
Skiet, skiet in je bitch d'r face
Nu heeft ze witte bakkebaard
Ik heb status in die rapgame
Rotjoch aka De Hakkelaar

[Verse 13: Rasskulz]
Ik ben opeens die hele nigga
Breng het terug naar die tijden toen ik ging stelen nigga
Dom, dom doen met m'n klasgenoten
Dat was toen, we inden klasgenoten
Ik haalde diploma zonder m'n best te doen
Gymnastiek, ik kon die shit het beste doen
De bel ging, ik ging het kicken op het schoolplein
Ik begon ineens te roken, ik werd higher dan een soulplane
Dat waren tijden van m'n eerste kop
Tegenwoordig wil ik voor een show eerst een kop
Want je boy is gaande nu
Zo vaak gevallen, maar ik stond weer op
Dus je boy is sowieso staande nu
Ben nog steeds met de zelfde mannen en ik heb nog steeds de zelfde plannen
Ik ben een real nigga en ik wil nog steeds money horen nigga, als je praat over een deal nigga
Zo van woef, dat was één kop
Geen [?] nigga, als ik zeg één kop
Ik pak op, logisch, noem my nigga John Doe
Ik ben met Kees de Koning, maar toch pak ik soms met John dough
SMP, spent money pronto
Kan wel voor je gooien, maar ik wil m'n money pronto
Zovan trek iets, trek iets
Zeg die niggas dan ""trek iets""
Spent niet alles in één keer, stack iets
Cv, nigga ik djoent dood
Jou geloof ik nooit meer, heel de dag is het [?]

[Verse 14: Scarface]
Blijf rennen voor die money noem het eurosport
Witte poeder en ik zorg dat het dinero wordt
Ijskoud lijkt dat de boy [?]
Zet iets in elkaar, zorg dat het keurig wordt
Vroege vogel voor de knapperige zaadjes
Geschorst van me zaken, je weet ik ben op knaken
Je weet ik ben op money
Vraag die nigger waar is
Vraag niet op het waar is
Rijd d'r net een Yaris
Yummie Yummie
En ik ruik fris, handcreme
Je chick houd m'n dick net een handrem
SKUUUUUUR
En ik voel me net een waggie

[?]

[?]
Ik 1-2 je, versnel je net Narsingh
Scarface, altijd eng als ik bars bring
Trap het net van Damme
Haters ga van me
Ik walg van jullie kakkerlakken zo van gadverdamme
Hmm, shit, ielg, jakkes
Kleine maakt stappen
Je gaat het leven vatten
Op zoek naar iemand die m'n swag kan sponsoren
De game kan niet zonder me
De boy blijft vorderen
Stap uit de chopper, doe een sessie in de hangar
Jij bent zo standaard, spang net een Spanjaard

[Verse 15: Adje]
Nigga, ik weet precies waar ik vandaan kom
Dus nigga, als ik rap, zorg ik dat die fucking shit aankomt
Ik krijg probs van mannen boven de 30
Op dat moment wordt die shit ff bevestigd
Young slodda, none other
Ik ga niet eens verder snapje, ik ben op m'n money"
Frans Duijts,Huil Niet Om Mij,,,"Don't cry for me, I can't see all those tears from you
Everything you have given I will carry with me all my life
But it's over and over for good
Don't cry for me because I haven't earned these tears
I could have said it before but I had nothing to explain
Yet you remain my best friend
Don't cry for me
I see how you feel here I never meant to be
But that dream I once had no longer exists
I had a long fight before I said
But I have to be honest even though I feel the pain
Don't cry for me, I can't see all those tears from you
Everything you have given I will carry with me all my life
But it's over and over for good
Don't cry for me because I haven't earned these tears
I could have said it before but I had nothing to explain
Yet you remain my best friend
Don't cry for me
Don't cry for me, I can't see all those tears from you
Everything you have given I will carry with me all my life
But it's over and over for good
Don't cry for me"
Frans Duijts,Ga Maar Vast Slapen,,,"Lived, sometimes caught that paid an artist
Fame and applause, that's what he chooses
But it runs through my blood
It moves and embraces me
The times when I can't be with you
Touch my soul and often hurt me
Because you are for me
My hope and trust
I stand for the people I love so much
But every word I sing makes me think of you again and again

Go to sleep soundly, just turn off the lights
I'll be entertaining here until it closes here
Don't stay up, dear, you know how it goes
One more sip, one more song
And I'm probably late again, as always

Despite the allure and shine of the night
I know you are alone at home waiting for me
And every moment lies alone dreaming
That tonight is yours, you don't give way
No must, no people, no one around us
And that our moment will also remain ours
I am again in front of the people I love so much
But every word I sing makes me think of you again and again

So, go to sleep, just turn off the lights
I'll be entertaining here until it closes here
Don't stay up, dear, you know how it goes
One more sip, one more song
And as always I am stuck again
So often away, always on the road
I wish I always had you with me
But the planks are waiting
The lamps are on
Forgive me dear, but unfortunately I have to go again

Go to sleep soundly, just turn off the lights
I'll be entertaining here until it closes here

Go to sleep soundly, just turn off the lights
I'll be entertaining here until it closes here
Don't stay up, dear, you know how it goes
One more sip, one more song
And I'm probably late again, as always
(La la la,)
Must be late again!
(La la la,)
As always, probably late again
(La la la,)
As always, probably late again"
Frans Duijts,Laat Me Nooit Alleen,,,"All words, all arguments
That make no sense
I want to do something about it
But I put it on too much
I don't want you to leave
But why is it now
Not as we want
While I love you so much
If I can choose my love
This will never pass
Because for me there is only one and that is you
Never, ever leave me alone
Where do I go (where do I go)
Without you
Never, ever leave me alone
Because where do I go (where do I go)
I can not live without you
I have found many hearts
Left behind me
I was never the best to talk it out
Every memory still hurts me a lot
I've learned from it
I hope it never will be again
If I can choose my love
This will never pass
Because for me there is only one and that is you
Never, ever leave me alone
Where do I go (where do I go)
Without you
Never, ever leave me alone
Because where do I go (where do I go)
I can not live without you
If I may choose
This will never pass
Because for me there is only one and that is you
Never, ever leave me alone
Where do I go (where do I go)
Without you
I ask you never, ever leave me alone
Because where do I go (where do I go)
I can not live without you
Not a day without you"
Frans Duijts,Waarom Kon Ik Jou Niet Vertrouwen,,,"I met you there
You walked down the street
It was in the rain
In the dark, late at night
I followed you
And was shocked by what I saw
You went with a guy
He paid you for one night
Why couldn't I trust you?
I never had you to myself
The love you are looking for in someone else
What I gave you was really meant
Why couldn't I rely on you?
Wasn't our love real?
How could I love you
You will ever regret it
Because you are only bad
You saw me in a mirror
You were startled and fled
But that to no avail
Because believe me when I say
Our love is over
No, it doesn't have to be me anymore
You have to believe me
It's over, really over
Why couldn't I trust you?
I never had you to myself
The love you are looking for in someone else
What I gave you was really meant
Why couldn't I rely on you?
Wasn't our love real?
How could I love you
You will ever regret it
Because you are only bad
Why couldn't I trust you?
Wasn't our love real?
How could I love you
You will ever regret it
Because you are only bad"
Frans Duijts,Helemaal  Verloren,,,"[Verse 1: Kevin]
Zorg dat je rustig doet, dan maak ik nu een kop
We staan bij Roy, we eten budget food
Ga minder uit, ben in de booth als ik m'n cuppie doe
Jij tapt alles op chicks
Bereken terug, nou kijk wat kut je doet
Aye, ik loop naar buiten, hoor sirenes loeien
Maar ik vlam meteen m'n hasj, alleen die hele goeie
Ik ben op kaas toch, ik stond wat eerder op vandaag
Maar maak vandaag wat ik gisteren heb opgemaakt
Shit, zo schiet het niet op
Ik ben bij Roy, heb gegeten en een tientje gegokt
Ja, of ben met Johnny bij de schnesy
Na 9 maanden buiten als een pasgeboren baby
Aye, ik heb een chickie hierzo achter
Der tieten en der asser compenseert met haar karakter
Ja, ze weet van me
Ik ben niet haar sugar daddy
Al m'n boys zijn op de weg en ze zoeken heavy

[Hook: Johnny Sellah]
Nachten in de cel, weet nog dat ze mij verdachten
Gooi een donnie in de kast en laat me vijf seconden wachten
Stapels in de lucht, het laat die bitches voor me zakken
Cocaïne zit gevouwen en die hasj verdeeld in plakken

[Verse 2: Johnny Sellah]
Gele vingers niet door eten van die ta3jin maar door tellen van die twee barkie stack
Potentiële clannies pompen in de city waar ze wonen
Ik ben op m'n hossel hard, ik voel me kibba op die deck
Money komt en gaat, al die vieze bitches ook
Geen lenzendruppels hier, maar spuit waarschijnlijk in d'r oog
Heb die money in m'n bol, zit waarschijnlijk veel te hoog
Want ik ga over lijken, shit, en al m'n hitters doen het ook
Neef ik ben op kaas, wat weet jij van, grinden zonder douchen
Pompstation niet tanken maar gewoon je tanden poetsen
Cijfers kwamen binnen maar dat kwam niet door de toetsen
Ik was offie tijdens schooltijd, ik moest hashib want we moesten, eten
Franse clannies, halve granny's, jij was op een iPhone in de tweede, ik op Nokia's met Duitse bricks
Wil nie asj, je weet dat ik al buiten zit, dus doe geen battel battle met me als je thuis gaat huilen, shiiiiiiit

[Hook: Young'Mills]
Ik ben aan het werk en ik ben op dreef
Ik weet niet waar ik ga belanden, maar als ik er kom...
Ga ik niet meer terug naar de plek waar ik steeg
Maar vergeet niet van waar ik kom, ze zien dat ik kom

[Verse 3: Johnny Sellah]
Laffie taffie shit, doe dan die bitch nou zijn gevallen
Voor die jongen op de weg met standaard sannie bij z'n ballen
Aan z'n hoofd alleen getallen, onder ogen dikke wallen
Doe die dingen die ze haat en die d'r never gaan bevallen
Scotoe zei me ""kifesh"" met die rommelige stack
Hou je overal paar donnies of wat deed je in die flat?
Zei ""meneer moet jij eens luisteren, wie denk je dat je bent?""
Rij met onzen over grenzen, heb geen tijd meer voor die trap

[Verse 4: Jairzinho]
'K laat d'r bellen op m'n iPhone, heb geen PGP
Wil een aantal Nokia's, doe ik niks mee, die zijn te heet
Je zal denken super sterk door de cijfers die ik smeed
Zie die stack kan niet in één zak, anders loopt de nigger scheef
Je wilt m'n jongens niet zien rennen naar die trap, line bling
In de velden zijn we helden zonder king
Zij zijn zomaar op het veld, ze spelen helden zonder king
Kweek die massa zonder shake, veel gewicht als ik beweeg
(a mi papi)

[Hook: Young'Mills](2x)
Ze zien dat ik kom
Ik ben aan het werk en ik ben op dreef
Ik weet niet waar ik ga belanden, maar als ik er kom...
Ga ik niet meer terug naar de plek waar ik steeg
Maar vergeet niet van waar ik kom, ze zien dat ik kom

[Verse 5: Menga - FMG]
M'n ogen low, maar ik loop geladen
Kan hem zomaar laden en hem op je richten
Ben met domme jongens, stel niet zomaar vragen
Anders word ik vals en moet ik op je switchen
Lomo hoofd, kom met een lange pijp
Wees voorbereid, ik wil niet anders zijn
Je draagt een maat te klein, daarom lijk je breed
Fuck je wifey, want die bitch gaat vreemd
M'n oude dingen ja dat waren foutjes, draag omin oudjes, net een rolstoel
Je bent niet ontgroend, je pakt soms groen, ik zei d'r ""bonjour"", ze zei me:""je m' appelle""...
Ik zie je kijkt boos, waarom? (waarom)
Ik zeg je, kijk uit of loop om
Je wilt echt niet dat ik daar kom
Mijn jongens die lopen niet om

[Hook]
Ik heb last van die fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys
Ik heb last van die fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys

[Verse 6: Revie - FMG]
Ze praten en gluren
Ik heb last van ze, net een blessure
Maak lawaai dus ze doen als m'n buren
Als ze sturen in die gehuurde
Mannen wachten op, maar we wachten niet komen agressief
Nee we lachen niet, ze verwachten niet
Maar dan is het te laat
Die mannen van mij hebben vaart
Ze doen en denken niet na
Als ze denken dan is het aan money, ze rennen en rijden in forries
Geef me geen reden
Als je komt over treden ga je overtreden, helemaal daar naar beneden
Overlevers

[Hook]
Ik heb last van die fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys
Ik heb last van die fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys
Ik heb last

[Verse 7: Sevirio - FMG]
Ik wil die paarse brieven net als aubergine
Kan niet blijven slapen want ik moet verdienen
Ben vroeg op die dek het is over tienen want als jongens roven in de schoolkantine
Zeg me waar wil je gaan, Marrakesh, tet-tet Tetoeaan
Ben met Soufiane en Madrid douane achternaam? Bouassa
A zemmel, zeg die mannen ben met camel
Zoeken ruggen net een kameel because bro?
We rappen op Franse arno
Ze rijden rondjes rijden langs bro, als ze pull up pull up moet je dampen
Aan de telefoon ik kantel, ik wil een connect met een Franse
(Ganggang, ik ben nog steeds verliefd...)

[Hook]
Ik heb last van die fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys
Ik heb last van die fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys, fuck boys
Toe, toe, toe, pow! Toe, toe, toe, pow!
Toe, toe, toe, Pow! Pow! Pow!

[Verse 8: Kevin]
Die alleen betaalde tank ik kom het naar je brengen broer ik ben actief jij lag te pitten blijf maar schapen tellen
Ik zweer ik krijg een lattie van die paarse vellen rappen schiet niet op me hoofd is heet laat me shano bellen
Fucking 2016 en ik move nog steeds haze
Chickie geeft me sloppie toppie en ik rowen weer de wave
Ey je hash is commercieel je hebt die goeie niet geblazed
Genoeg opties in het veld het is te moeilijk hoe je denkt
Dat was, slow flow op een kleine versnelling mannen praten tegen bitches en verdwijnen de cel in. Al m'n lines zijn magnifiek als je niet kijkt naar de spelling, maar dat krijg je als je zoveel hebt gespijbeld als Kevin
John is onderweg nu naar de vijfde bestelling
Ik heb sleutels van de booth ben 1 op 1 met deze mic
Momi is m'n buurman zeg 'm kifesh met die wifi ik heb geen bereik, ik had alvast een gedraaid
Voor ik aankwam ey straks is m'n money en m'n haar lang Diesel leven spaarstand, Kev had al een aanhang
Maar rappen of  de roads ik zit er tussen in, koop een liter hazes van de money van m'n publishing
Zoveel power daar dat ze m'n naam boven der kutje inkt en jij staat in de min zelfs op OV, jij mag de bus niet in

[Verse 9: Johnny Sellah]
Ze liked geen mooiboys meer ze valt alleen op tuig, meisjes blijven meisjes maar ze vallen nog alleen op buit
Beter blijf je thuis, stack je money in de meterkast wordt waker zonder kater en dan merk je dat het beter was dan spenden op die kech, één henny fuck de rest, kan de toekomst niet voorspellen maar ben vaker op de weg, dan die mensen van de ANWB, je hebt geen status in de tent je kech die gaat met mij mee
Money pakken ik verdubbel neef ik heb geen heimwee, na die stack van gisternacht want echt ik heb 'm keer twee
In m'n zakken niet gewisseld maar gewassen HC
Ben in het zuiden pas te borden stalen ballen in de plaza BP Dat is wiet, stack lang four feet
Koop de hele bar leeg jij en je matties spenden samen zag je delen voor free
Maar je werd alsnog gescott door de wakoe met 't v'tje gister dom een kop verloren dacht ik had de hele straat dus ik ging dom all-in
Maar echt ik had alleen een steegje mattie ik ben in de ban van: hoeren neuken, money tellen en me drugs pushen
We werken hard dus denk niet dat we naar geluk zoeken
Ik ging te snel dus kan niet klagen om die kut boete
Klem meerdere clannies denken niet dat we hier naar kut zoeken

[Hook: Chip Charlez]
Begrijp me niet verkeerd, de avond is jong dat weet je
'T is net iets voor 9
Dus we kunnen bewegen naar de dansvloer wij tweeën
Again en laat mij zien, wat jij in huis hebt, oh meisje alsjeblieft

[Verse 10: Chip Charlez]
Je aanwezigheid is meer dan genoeg dat weet je
Je wordt rood is dat make-up of ben je verlegen
Begrijp me niet verkeerd je weet je kent m'n streken maar Waarom ben je boos trap ik op je gelakte teentjes
Nou dat was, niet mijn, bedoeling je weet dat, niet goed ging, dus ik ontvang, ik ontvang, ik ontvang een tjoerdi van jou

[Hook]
Even lang op die dek

[Verse 11]
Zij zijn niet even lang, op die dek als wij maar ey
Wil die stack beetje lang, gepakt en opzij gezet
Ik ga wat harder nu, logisch dat ik op cijfers let
Ik heb m'n tijd genomen het is niet dat ik getwijfeld heb dus ey
We komen nu aan op bestemming in hele enge whip
Ik heb jongens die rennen je flat in en duwen hele enge wit
Genoeg opties hier om te kiezen hou alles correct net een pitch
Alles is hier als m'n damma mijn life gaat sneller dan een flits

[Hook]
Even lang op die dek
Even lang op die dek
Even lang op die dek als wij
Even lang op die dek

[Verse 13: BKO]
Soms denk ik aan mensen die ik pijn deed, ben niet vaak thuis door m'n moeder krijg ik heimwee
En soms denk ik aan dingen die ik kon hebben, als ik bleef stacken kon ik meer dan een ton hebben
Soms ben ik met mannen op die gun gun
Jullie zijn Spaans jullie schreeuwen vaak ""gang gang""
Soms zit ik in het donker met m'n pistol, denk ik bij me zelf wanneer ga ik in die Bristol
Soms ga ik naar kuit voor die coco
Chain is gold en die Roley wil ik gross gold
Soms zit ik met ton aan aan me mensen plan, marra komt binnen en hij vraagt me Otje what's the plan?
Ik kan niet denken aan toen ik wil m'n money heel snel, ja die millie komt soon dat is wat ik kan doen
Al me mannen zijn op djoen niet praten maar doen
Is de tijd rijp ja dan pakken we die plantsoen

[Hook: BKO 2x]
Soms blow ik met ton in de PC
Soms ben ik met Chase, we the Chasecake
Soms ben ik met kaas, in the main thing
Lobben is er ook, Queen Elizabeth to get cake

[Verse 14: BKO]
Soms ben ik met mannen die geen grap maken
By get protect jezelf voor die zwak dagen
Soms ben ik met blakka over guap praten
In de escuuf mij zie je niet bij thuis saven
Soms ben ik met Raz nigga get cake
Nigga is manager die shit doe het echt heet
Soms denk ik aan tijden toen ik broke was

[Hook: BKO 2x]
Soms blow ik met ton in de PC
Soms ben ik met Chase, we the Chasecake
Soms ben ik met kaas, in the main thing
Lobben is er ook, Queen Elizabeth to get cake

[Verse 15: BKO]
Ik ben op zoek naar een schat
Als ik jou was had ik guap
We slachten kippen voor het feest
Ben op mula boy het is goed dat je weet
We gaan overseas voor die benz
Geef die bitches backy's en dat zonder hands
Maar je moet niet letten op m'n taalgebruik
Je laatste stack, je hebt het al gebruikt
Tot het uiterst als we uitgaan
Meiden om ons heen als we uitgaan
M'n nigger Tonchi is buiten
Dat betekent dat je moet verhuizen
Ik zie jou haten maar je luistert
Deze dagen doen die mannen duister
Je hoort 'Pow Pow' in het duister
Dat is wat hier wordt gefluisterd
Dat is libie in de bimms
Wil die benz strak ik ben een bink
Mannen zetten dingen in je drinken
Ondertussen pakte ik een winst
Hold up, zeg ze hold up
Die witte hier fucked je nose op
Hold up, zeg ze hold up
Ze me niet flexen met een ho toch
Je praat slecht over mij als het goed gaat ben je weer m'n bro toch
Kan niet fokken met die fakers
Kan niet fokken met die fufu's
Een paar mensen doen djudju
Wil protection en die doekoe
M'n vader zegt me doe rustig
Het komt goed in de future
Ik zeg ze ""follow je lane, luister niet naar die mensen daar om je heen""
Ben back immaa set it straight
Nieuwe whip want we pakken cake
Zet het recht in je face
Ik doe die dingen voor m'n race
Overseas voor die benz

Ja die Louis patta en die Loubou patta

Ben blij, Gucci is buiten, Fuck de other side, ze weten het ook
Overseas voor die benz

Ik breng alles in je hood, ik ben de supplier

[Verse 16: Sevn Alias]
Import, export, transport, ik lever het af als een escort
Kortom ik ben op me zout
Ren door de regen al heb ik het koud
Last van me benen maar ik kan niet vergeten dat ik uit moet blijven kijken voor blauw, voor die sirenes ga ik niet in de fout
Zelfs me moeder die weet dat ik trap
Nam ik niet op had ze stress
Ging wel naar scorro maar niet naar de les
Ik was allang op mijn stacks
Jaartje geleden was mijn life een mess
Gaddo die heeft me geblessed
Maar toch blijf ik met die mil op die deck
Mijn fonna die doe ik niet weg

[Hook: Sevn Alias 2x]
Mijn fonna die gaat global, bel me op en place je order
Ik breng die shit over de border, ik heb alles wat je zoekt

[Verse 17: Sevn Alias]
Handelingen die lijken opeens kan ik niet tolereren
Kijk je in je ogen aan als we over money converseren
Ik ben niet het type nigga die zich naar je om gaat keren
Kan je confronteren en naar osso sturen zonder kleren
On de run ik doe dit sinds jong
Als iba3sh achtervolgd dan kijk ik niet achterom
Mijn stack is een opsom, één doezoe, twee doezoe
Alles voor die millie upcoming, 3 doezoe, 4 doezoe, ik ben gevorderd
Breng die shit over de border, ik heb schijt aan de gevolgen
Ben op zoek naar money voor morgen

[Hook: Sevn Alias 2x]
Mijn fonna die gaat global, bel me op en place je order

Pull up, come again, two shots, ja dat ding

[Verse 22: Lil' Saint]
Zo zeg ik loop niet van stapel
Omdat ik nu loop met die stapels
Ik geloof niet in die fabels
Ben positic ik kom net als krakels
Voor die money ren ik net een antilope
Altijd in de car ik ben anti-loop
Houd je staande terwijl je met je mattie loopt
Of met de pan je weet wat ik kook
Ik ben de beste kill wie is er beter ik grind net een skater en ik pak nu paper
Kom mij niet testen bitch ik kan je sprayen
Wees op je paper want Nevlo is heter
Ik heb geen tijd houd het kort
Mensen korteren je scort
Mellende die hebben honger
Keneten eten van je bord
Ze remmen geen lessen ik kan het wel testen, ze moet wel beseffen dit is maar voor ff
Voor mij loesoe mattie ik boss d'r attie
Ik geef d'r alleen lean ze zegt me: ""Ik ben de devil""
Je weet allang dat ik kneel
Saint Sosa draai net een wiel
Pull up m'n swag die is ill
Bad bitch in m'n kamer ze knielt
Het loopt uit de hand maar heb niks vast
Stacks in m'n zakken en op m'n pinpas
Blijf drukken zodat het erin past
Trek het eruit zodat dat erin was
Drie niggers ze willen me klonen
Twee grammen geblowt ben een stoner
Ice om m'n nek kan niet slippen
Ik tik dit het barst net als bommen

[Hook]
We d-d-d-d we don't stop

Lange clip, ik heb er drie (Breh)
Mijn leven is een film, dit is deel vier (Waaah)
Pak ik vier, kill, ik deel vier

Roley lijkt op een casino maar we gokken niet
Money op me mind ik word rich

Ogen laag, doe een geh die money hoog in me bol
Ken een man uit '82 en hij stoot voor de lol
Pakte meer dan ik kon spenden, schoenendoos die zat vol
De mijne nog op alpha vaste lasten zijn dom
Want ik ga nog steeds beneden, niet voor cijfers op school
Heb een stapel in m'n patta, in m'n schoen zit geen zool
Ik heb die shit die je wil, ik heb die shit die je had
Heb geen sannie op me naam, ben nooit met dealen gepakt
Heel me fonna is gebost maar kan niet dealen voor dat
We kunnen bellen met m'n stack dat is m'n dealer gedrag

[Hook]
We d-d-d-d we don't stop
We d-d-d-d we don't stop

[Verse 26: Kevin]
Hey doe niet bang als ik op je af dribbel
Bom in me zak maar geen gordel om m'n middel
K-k-kev ze hebben last van mij
Ik heb me Redbull koud en me hasj gedraaid
Een Macbook pro en een fucking mic
Kill je gaat redden, neef de kans is klein
Kev uit de basis is wanbeleid
W-w-we don't stop, ik heb lang gegrind
Ik heb nu zelfs een paar kleine showtjes
Weer een paar meijer dat is bonus
Onderweg, we pompen opium lotus
Fuck die chimi's, MOB, ben op focus"

Then why do I have to be lonely now
While I long for you
I am homesick and sad
Being happy, I can't

Far away
To paradise
Happy as a child
And I waved my wings to you
On a cloud
Or the most beautiful ray of sunshine
Only to you
Preferably I asked
Please come along
Come fly with me over land and sea
The wind that brings us to happiness
There is no going back without one goal
But only with you
With you
I gave you a home under my wing

Where you are happy
Your own house
I have often gone on that journey alone
Without you
But I came back
You were too far away
Preferably I asked
Please come along
Come fly with me over land and sea
The wind that brings us to happiness
There is no going back without one goal
But only with you
With you
The wind that brings us to happiness
No return without return
But only with you
With you
With you"
Jannes,In Gedachten Fluister Ik Jouw Naam,,,"[Lyrics of ""My Son"" ft. Janne Schra]

[Verse 1: Fresku]
I don't know who I am with a little boy
But I don't want to know who I am without you
I'm watching a miracle and I can't lose it
So we kneel and we pray for a miracle now
Maybe I haven't prayed often enough
It's gonna drive me crazy, but I'm looking for a reason
Is it written like that? How many tears should I shed?
How much must a father's heart endure in this life?
But your strength to fight makes me strong just as much
Your dad will never give up
My heart as heavy as a brick
But since day 1, your dad has stayed cool
I take your little hand, it won't stop shaking
Your eyes are closed, but your heart doesn't stop wanting
I'm posting, ""please folks, don't stop praying""
And a moment later thousands of loving messages
You are the proof, love brings people together
A few days, boy, so many people are thinking about you
They say my son has his daddy's willpower
But I fear breaking myself, never been so afraid

[Pre-Chorus: Fresku]
I've never been so scared
But fight for me boy, nothing is stronger than your mind
I've never been so scared
But fight for me, boy

[Chorus: Janne Schra]
Fight for your mother, fight for your father
Fight for love, fight for the world
Fight for your life and don't give up
You have to fight, my son
My son

[Verse 2: Fresku]
I hold my heart watching your heartbeat
What would your chances be if it were up to the doctor?
My head takes that wrong turn
Got sick of the idea and broke my heart
Light in my head, sometimes my hope goes away for a while
Because nothing is promised except what you fight against
Fight for me, little prince, your journey begins
And now you give everything because the greatest warrior wins
And we don't win without a fight
But great creator, I beg you, not my children
Thoughts gloomy, secluded
Everything black and dark, feel tied down
Stay here with daddy, I can't live without it
The world already finds you special
Your mother whispers in your ear, she says, ""Wake up""
When I'm with your sisters, I have to act big
And I'll hide in the toilet as soon as my eyes water
People are starting to ask me a lot
And can't stay strong if I have to talk about it
I tell your mother, ""I'm going to make sure he has everything""
But I fear breaking myself, never been so afraid

[Pre-Chorus: Fresku]
I've never been so scared
But fight for me boy, nothing is stronger than your mind
I've never been so scared
But fight for me, boy

[Chorus: Janne Schra]
Fight for your mother, fight for your father
Fight for love, fight for the world
Fight for your life and don't give up
You have to fight, my son
My son"

Frans Bauer,Trein Naar Niemandsland,,,"There is a train running to no man's land
He's on his way to the promised land
And along the way you can hear the angels sing
It seems like a dream, that heavenly song
As final station: Paradise
The ticket is a one-way ticket
You will find peace there one day
Although no one here gets any proof
There is a train running to no man's land
Where the hell fire burns for no one
Only one flame will warm everyone
It's the love you long for
Saying goodbye hurts everyone
You want so badly to be with that other person
What remains are a thousand beautiful dreams
But your heart is on that last train
See the tunnel illuminate you
Far to the heaven gate
There you will recognize faces again
It is what you hope for
There is a train running to no man's land
He's on his way to the promised land
And along the way you can hear the angels sing
It seems like a dream, that heavenly song
As final station: Paradise
The ticket is a one-way ticket
You will find peace there one day
Although no one here gets any proof
The train that stops for you in paradise"

[Verse 1: Nina]
Am I too little and is what I do good enough? (Yeah)
With every text I would like to know how I do (How then)
Who would hear it, I see full houses before me (Oh)
But will I succumb or perform properly? (Hmm)
Will I be judged on my skills or what I look like?
Because yes, I am a buddy, but shit, that doesn't really matter, does it? (No)
If they think, ""She's a girl"", don't see me as an equal
And refuse to compare my skills with boys (Pssh)
Lack of ladies at the top, it sometimes makes me doubt (Huh)
Am I in between and why am I actually doing it?
Around me I just hear, ""Hey, a lady, finally"" (Hey)
That's why I just wanna prove it wrong (Yeah)
We are seen as inferior in many aspects
Even at work, because you were at home with the kids (Huh)
Shit, as a woman I know inferiority complexes
That's why I keep on reprising for the ladies (Oh)

[Chorus: Brownie Dutch]
Do you think I'm inferior?
Am I worthless sometimes?
You can lower me
Because you won't get me angry today
You don't have to love me
I do like myself
But no one is without mistakes
But you say I'm too little, oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Nina,
Ali b
]
Am I too little?
Am I, am I too little?
Yeah
, am I too little?
Ey
Am I too ...

[Verse 2: Ali B]
Am I too low to the ground because I don't rap about haters, conclaves like that
A status symbol turns a weapon into a lot
Violent promotion, you never see me as a popie
Waving a gun, high on the weed smoke, okidoki
Then I am only too little, then I am only too miserable
It's a shit fable when they say
""Rapping is not for those kids, let me make a hit
Where I connect marijuana, whiskey glasses and bitches together ""
Because that's for real men
That's for street rappers with sincere plans
Not for you, Ali B
No, you are a shame
You are a downside to the rappers with skills
I want to kick you out of the scene myself
See me as a weakling for singing with Marco B.
Or coincidentally with Frans Bauer, they distrust me
Because everything I do is as wrong as it can be
Well, I long for a stable way of living by making subtle choices
And I don't just mean the more serious matters
I like to participate in a games program more often
Am I too little for that? Is that why I am a drama? Fuck it

[Chorus: Brownie Dutch]
Do you think I'm inferior?
Am I worthless sometimes?
You can lower me
Because you won't get me angry today
You don't have to love me
I do like myself
But no one is without mistakes
But you say I'm too little, oh-oh

[Verse 3: Nina]
Am I too little? It's a familiar question
But I keep my head up and my shoulders down (Yeah)
But put my hand up when you ask about the women (Oh)
They said, ""Nina, don't do it"", but I wish it too bad (Yeah)
It's a world full of arrogant men
That's why I give one hundred percent times three, this is Sparta
Where only real women can hang out with the men
And I'm Amsterdam, so I'm not banned (Uh-uh)
I fought too much to not be able to play
I'm not running for fame up my ass
No, I have something to share
They say, ""Music has a downside""
I keep explaining them, it can also be a bit more
I am a warrior, want to be treated as an equal
For more ladies with skills that enrich the game
Don't like bullies, you have to feel those skills
So when I use the word bitch I can mean a man too (Ohh)

[Chorus: Brownie Dutch]
Do you think I'm inferior?
Am I worthless sometimes?
You can lower me
Because you won't get me angry today
You don't have to love me
I do like myself
But no one is without mistakes
But you say I'm too little, oh-oh

That's how it goes every time
Totally blinded by that one woman
Collapse my whole dream again
She's not fair, I already knew that
Still, I keep giving her
Another chance, but what am I supposed to do?
It makes no sense
Come dance with me the tango of love
Come dance with me the tango of amor
Please stay with me because you are all my life
Whatever you do, I want to be close to you
Deep in thought I hear it again
Always warns me that voice
Let her go, you don't deserve this
She smiles at every guy
But the feeling around me is my pain
Even if she hurts me so much
I miss her warmth and tenderness
I want to see her again and again
Come dance with me the tango of love
Come dance with me the tango of amor
Please stay with me because you are all my life
Whatever you do, I want to be close to you
You pass by in every love song
Why do I love you much more and you love me
Please stay with me because you are all my life
Whatever you do, I want to be close to you
Whatever you do, I want to be close to you"

You said your heart was broken right?
And that's why I gave you mine
I kept it to myself, right?
If I knew it would make you disappear
Now I am walking around an empty house
Just a mirror that looks at me
Black hole in my soul that sucks me out
From the city to the silence drive up again
Full pride, my chest out
I don't miss you, I don't miss you, I don't miss you

In the kitchen with that mustard dressing
Make 100 pokus that I forget again
In the middle between sometimes and never
The answer is whether I smoke and know less
5 o'clock in the morning it is midweek
She watches me eat a bridge
Spinning with a thick haze
And she just wants my kids in her face
Way too panja for those phonestories
Apparently it is something motor
Doctors tell me no worries
But start to sleep before your head flies
Carriages become ghost stories
Can't be heavens now oh lordy
Smoke through that horny hoo
For a bone for who smokes too beau for me
That's oh torpid for that Drink in me I feel so Geordie
Apparently it is motor
So I keep drinking until I die here
I review my new rings one by one
Got one for money and now and one for fame
If you look at it like that I would stay put
But the rules on both courses changed
Omin drugs, better had none
I watch that shit and take it one by one
Then fold everything together in those paper planes
And make that shit disappear just like David Blaine

You can ask me what I'm doing
But I can't really explain now
Nights are days it makes me tired
And I can't make it real now
I cannot die like Cobain
That pipe of peace gives me

I cannot die like Cobain
So look at nothing like a problem
I cannot die like Cobain
With the blowed brains homie no way

[Verse 2]
Inhale smoke like o2 so that a
Hope fame doesn't float to my head
Once had dreams of all that fame
Now I am in my room and I cannot do anything
Lost all my friends I don't understand how
I enjoy encountering what I do
I know men who prefer to see me down
That's why I just look up
I have stress that I prefer not to show
And it works because of what I smoke
Hear those lies I keep disbelieving
Used to find me, but I don't know
On a Road Trip or Alone in the O
Tell those who are looking for me I better not die

I cannot die like Cobain
So look at nothing like a problem"
Ramses,Het Is Stil In Amsterdam,,,"[Lyrics of ""Three Musketeers"" ft. Lady Di & Ali B]

[Intro: Ali B]
Yes Yes
Yes-R, Lady Di, Ali motherfucking B
And we come to get you
You better run, motherfucker
Run, run

[Verse 1: Yes-R]
Ali, Ladi Di and Yes-R, motherfucker, this is our time
Maybe not the MCs with the most punchlines
I can't help it that your sister keeps looking at us
Hate it motherfucker and watch me rise after the top
Still, I remain myself, not like most
I'll drop my first album, but pay close attention to the second
This is SPEC. Entertainment, our raps are boring
If you think of breaking me, your respect is gone
Bitch, run, this is our territory
Your shit sounds more yolk than a corpse in a crematorium
Beatkidz and Yes-R have feature [?] Value
Indeed, I have my teen hits ready
I'm a lyrical danger, so you will be cleared clinically
Other rappers, beware, no one is spared here

[Chorus: Lady Di & Yes-R]
We are three twenty-first century musketeers
We hunt prey and tear it like a lion
So run for your life, bitch, run for your life
Run for your life, bitch, run for your life
We are three twenty-first century musketeers
We hunt prey and tear it like a lion
So run for your life, bitch, run for your life
Run for your life, bitch, run for your life

[Verse 2: Lady Di]
A thousand bombs and grenades land, it's Di
I'm terrorizing the beat with Yes-R and Ali
Conquer the entire Dutch hip-hop nation
With more impact than a tsunami
I'm a chick, but believe me, dude
Roll over rappers like a bulldozer
It's over, Lady Di represent those chicks here in Holland
Players in the country, get ready for your downfall
Moppie, moppie, break my heart
And I'll break your head and the rest of your posse, huh
I'll list the facts, as it turns out
Half of those rappers fail on the mic
This is my time, my moment
Believe me, you're old-fashioned if you don't know me
Dusseh, from Den Bosch to Amsterdam
L-A-D Greek Y D-I, what were you thinking?

[Chorus: Lady Di & Yes-R]
We are three twenty-first century musketeers
We hunt prey and tear it like a lion
So run for your life, bitch, run for your life
Run for your life, bitch, run for your life
We are three twenty-first century musketeers
We hunt prey and tear it like a lion
So run for your life, bitch, run for your life
Run for your life, bitch, run for your life

[Verse 3: Ali B]
Yo, I flow too ill, so they send me to a doctor
A lot of rappers criticize, but I have more style in my mars
I keep it simple, yet I can easily dismiss rappers
Always dressed like the best, but never tight in a suit
Call me a snake or a rat, but you won't get me loco
Chill on a hanging [?] Relaxed on the beach of Morocco
Am a bon vivant, treat myself, yes
Now haters want to shoot me, but I'm too fast for that
Saïd Aouita of the rappers, pass in a sprint
I don't give a fuck about your government, have my own government
With corrupt ministers like Alphalicious and Yes-R
I was never mother's prettiest, yet bitches showed interest
But that's because of my successes, ey yo, I don't fall for that
Those fucking money wolves are chasing my card and my pin

[Chorus: Lady Di & Yes-R]
We are three twenty-first century musketeers
We hunt prey and tear it like a lion
So run for your life, bitch, run for your life
Run for your life, bitch, run for your life
We are three twenty-first century musketeers
We hunt prey and tear it like a lion
So run for your life, bitch, run for your life
Run for your life, bitch, run for your life"

But I am not for ADO for Ajax
I'm gonna put your balls in the sand, sand, sand
Money into forests
Tel Aviv with a Jew, shall open that bitch
Albert tub with mick, a lot of gold in a mik
Die in the bread, pile of salt in that shit
I am relatively tall, with Gotu come sick
Saturblues I come slick, saturflus I come now
Designer trousers and a click, money magnifier that's me
Planga [?] Can, oh sauce I drip
Up like a jack, gap jump in that elevator
Your headlines or nut, bro show a little bit
Bro show a little guts, come clean just like Dreft
Yes, [?]

I want an icy corona
I want to fuck you on the beach, beach, beach
I'll cum on your head soon

Frank Boeijen,Zeg me dat het niet zo is,,,"[Chorus]
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it's not true

Tell me it isn't
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it's not true

[Verse 1]
are you coming this evening
To our favorite restaurant?
A table for two
I called
They know about it
And we drink
Until the sun comes up
And we forget
The dishonesty of fate

[Chorus]
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it's not true

Tell me it isn't
Tell me it isn't
Tell me it's not true

[Verse 2]
Let's go
Put on your jacket
Otherwise it will be too late
Come here, I'll hold you, I'll never let you go
And I'll tell you a joke that makes you cry with laughter
And we forget the looks of the people in the city

We pretend it isn't
As if it is not so
As if it is not true

We pretend she just lives on
As if she just lives on
Even if it isn't"
Frank Boeijen,Vaderland,,,"It's a fair in hell
It rains while the sun is shining
On the other side of the world
How would it be at home now?
The sun broke through the horizon
The waves keep coming
The palm trees along the beach
The fishermen in their boats
Traveling keeps you moving
But now you stopped
Now you stop
With the past
Motherland waterland
Fatherland without a father
Now that I think of you so far away
Where it rains in the water
A man is kneeling in the mosque
And somewhere a rooster is crowing
Soon the prayers will begin
And everyone wakes up
A mother washes her child
In the foaming water
The fishermen return
With stories for later
Traveling keeps you moving
But now you stopped
Now you stop
With the past
Motherland waterland
Fatherland without a father
Now that I think of you so far away
Through the rain through the water
Cloud land gray land
Winterland skating land
Tree land ditches
Green land, proud land
And the sun will set here again
Then the sky is on fire
Can you see the smoke can you see the smoke
There in my
Motherland motherland
Fatherland without a father
Now that I think of you so far away
Through the rain through the water
Motherland motherland
Homeland country of birth
Rainland flat land
Rich country small country
Polderland new land
Promised land no man's land
Free country Iceland
Sand country river country
Zeeland sandy land
Small-minded country clog land
Millland farmland
City country road country
Grassland marshy land
Coastal tulip land
Dijkenland clay island
Maasland drowned land
Lowland herringland
Duinenland economical land
Coffee country cheese country
Amsterdam Rotterdam
Hollow land full of land
Wet land cold land
My country your country
Our country
Native country"
Frank Boeijen,Als Schelpen In Het Zand,,,"And the wind that blows
The thoughts gone
The turtle drinks the tears
From the country so far

Where the father has disappeared
Behind the horizon
Ascended like a swallow
He left with a smile

In the night he appears
The eyes open so wide
In the morning he disappears
With the rays of the sun

It is written in my heart
That long last day
When we were left together
Like shells in the sand

The monk speaks his prayers
For the restless soul
Who cannot find heaven
Can't see through the clouds

There are countless questions
Written in the air
When the wind blows
The answer comes back

All that has been described
In the water in the fire
When the fear is gone
In the last hour

It is written in my heart
That long last day
When we were left together
Like shells in the sand"
Frank Boeijen,Gras,,,"I've lost my mother a hundred times
In dreams
In winters
To a stone city
Born of her to other children
And to father
Loved trembling

Only a hundred times
I won her back
Stretch out in plain green grass
That breathed and toiled or rashly
Rippled like a song
And wavy was eternal

Be gentle
Be endless
All poor
Grass mother
Mother grass
Trembling compassion

Behind us, the human sky is red
The clouds sail
The birds float
Teach me to live with one heart too much
Until I can get away in both your lap

Only a hundred times
I won her back
Stretch out in plain green grass
That breathed and toiled or rashly
Rippled like a song
And wavy was eternal"
Frank Boeijen,Avond,,,"Dogs bark in the street
Before night falls
I'm hungry and I'm getting drunk
In an unknown city
This cafe is open day and night
That's what a woman says next to me
The story of her life
Looks like yours
She looks like you
And here the devil speaks of the drink
Take her to the promised land
Rent a room with flowers on the wallpaper
Don Quixote becomes Don Juan
Don Quixote becomes Don Juan
I suggest eating
Here somewhere in Ghent
We walk on the cobblestones
Let me forget who I am
That dark silence hangs over the city
Which might suit us
And a singer is singing at the table
About a memory
A memory
Later an open door is kicked in
The hotel room with flowers on the wallpaper
The reward for a desperate man
Don Quixote becomes Don Juan
Don Quixote becomes Don Juan
The reward for a desperate man
Is this the reward
For a desperate man"
Frank Boeijen,De Ontmoeting,,,"Come on let's go
The bottle is empty
I'll take you home
It's safe

We have talked
After all this time
We have laughed
To mistakes
How it would have gone
It's too late now

But your face
And your mouth
It's so familiar
It's unbearable
That distance
I would love to
With you
Oh dear

It makes no sense
To stand still
With what happened
Do not you think

What more can I do
What more can you do
Then move on
To live on
With this reminder
This madness
Don't stop
I let you go

But your face
And your mouth
It's so familiar
It's unbearable
That distance
I would love to
With you
Oh dear

Your arms
And your eyes
It's so familiar
It's unbearable
That distance
I would love to
With you
Oh dear"
Frank Boeijen,Twee Mannen Zo Stil,,,"Two men so quiet
Hand in hand
At a funeral
From a friend
Give a handkerchief
Don't tell anyone
A reservoir of tears
Pushes out time
What is grief
Is it an enemy or a friend
Let's go dance
Until it no longer works
Until dawn
Two men so quiet
Hand in hand
Saying goodbye
From a friend
They storm the sky
They disappear into the night
They run and they drink
They laugh at the impotence
What is grief
Is it an enemy or a friend
Let's go dance
Until it no longer works
Until dawn
Two men so quiet"
Roxeanne Hazes,Ik was toch je meisje,,,"[Verse 1]
You were that guy
Who had conquered me?
You were the hunter, I was the prize
Still, I wasn't enough for you
I do not need you
No, don't sit down and hope
You no longer determine where I go
What I do and leave

[Pre-Chorus]
How you walk, your sleeves rolled up
Can't forget
Either way, you have to get out of my head
And from my life

[Chorus]
You called, I came
I gave, you took it all
You beg again for a new beginning
But honey it makes no sense
I know I bitch
But what you do is not normal
You beg again for a new beginning
But honey it makes no sense

[Verse 2]
I was your girl, wasn't I?
You stay in my memory
You remain the man where I am
Could be myself
It's finally over
And you have to promise me
Don't come after me
It's too late now

[Pre-Chorus]
How you walk, your sleeves rolled up
Can't forget
Either way, you have to get out of my head
And from my life

[Chorus]
You called, I came
I gave, you took it all
You beg again for a new beginning
But honey it makes no sense
I know I bitch
But what you do is not normal
You beg again for a new beginning
But honey it makes no sense

I was your girl, wasn't I?
I was your girl, wasn't I?"
Roxeanne Hazes,Judaskus,,,"[Verse 1]
Your lips on my mouth
But I am completely numb
I taste salty tears on my tongue
And your words are running through my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you love me, that you trust me
Without a doubt in your voice
What have I done? Let myself go
No idea who I am anymore
All I wanted is to be with you
But I only think about him, ooh

[Chorus]
I betray you with a Judas kiss
And leave our bed while you sleep
And I know I'll miss you tomorrow
But I just went too far

[Post-Chorus]
Tu-du-du
Tu-du-du-du
Tu-du-du-du-tu

[Verse 2]
Your eyes in my back
But I am all his
Too late, because I can't go back
Even though I keep hearing your voice

[Pre-Chorus]
That you love me, that you trust me
And knows me like no other
What have I done? Let myself go
But I remember who I am
All I wanted is to be with you
So what am I doing with him? Ooh

I betray you with a Judas kiss
And leave our bed while you sleep
And I know I'll miss you tomorrow

Roxeanne Hazes,Terug,,,"[Verse 1]
When you left I was sure
It's better for both of us
I had my thing, you had your thing
So it just wasn't supposed to be
Everything we laughed about then
Whether it was nothing now hurts so much
And the emptiness, you must know
Is much bigger than it should have been
So I ask you now

[Chorus]
Come back into my life
Before you forget who I was
I hate it when you say
I now share the bed with someone else
It doesn't look like you
It's so disappointing to me
How it feels here alone at night
So can I have you back now?

[Verse 2]
All silences in the room
Any questions you no longer ask
Every week, every day
All the hours that I no longer count
And if I had known then
What it feels like to be alone
Oh, I can't forget you
So I beg you come back
Back to me, come back to me

[Chorus]
Come back into my life
Before you forget who I was
I hate it when you say
I now share the bed with someone else
It doesn't look like you
It's so disappointing to me
How it feels here alone at night
So can I have you back now?
Come back to me"

Thijs Boontjes
]
I looked into his eyes and quickly around me
He had been waiting here, I knew that immediately
Already four years ago, she didn't see me
Would have avoided me well, it was not the fault

[Chorus: Together]
If I say I still love you
Is it too late now for regret and remorse?
This is much shorter than eternal faithfulness
Now that death divides us again

[Verse 2:
Thijs Boontjes
 & Roxeanne Hazes]
Well, you never know how it will turn out in life
I just know this was not promised to me
Oh, he reached for his jacket pocket and aimed at me
He said, ""Rox, I'm sorry,"" then it was over

[Chorus: Together]
If I say I still love you
Is it too late now for regret and remorse?
This is much shorter than eternal faithfulness
Now that death divides us again

[Bridge:
Thijs Boontjes

I hear the sirens calling my name
I can finally really let you go
If I say I still love you
Honey, what are you making me?

This is much shorter than eternal faithfulness
Now that death divides us again"

[Verse 1]
You can hate me, talk behind my back
I am who I am
I will stop anyway, yes, just get used to it
Because I am who I am
They hate on you and me
I have a lot of trouble being myself
I've been fighting too long
To the people who expect much more than I can give
They talk about you and me
And think we know who we are
It doesn't affect me

[Pre-Chorus]
I put on a mask
That's how I go through life
So that nobody knows me
I've given up hope

[Chorus]
I will stand still, yes, get used to it
Because I am who I am
Often unloved but not yet written off
No, no, oh no
It doesn't affect me
No, no, oh no

[Verse 2]
Often misunderstood, but that's life
It is what it is
I laugh with grief but don't tell you
Well, it is what it is
They talk about you and me
Far too many people who don't really understand what I mean
That's why I find it difficult to just talk about my feelings
They hate on you and me
And think we know who we are
It does me nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
I put on a mask
That's how I go through life
So that nobody knows me
I've given up hope

[Chorus]
I will stand still, yes, get used to it
Because I am who I am
Often unloved but not yet written off
No, no, oh no
It does me nothing
No, no, oh no"

[Verse 1]
With a smile and a tear
I think back to then, I see us standing there
You looked at me and you said
""Hey you come here with me for a moment""
You kissed me long and soft
And I remember thinking
That love was hard to find
It was a good time, very unexpected
And yes, I've often thought about it
How you loved me then

[Chorus]
Because until now I saw love
Only in my dreams
But now it had finally come my way
It all turned out to be so much closer
Will never forget it
Because suddenly, there you were
Yes yes you
you

[Verse 2]
""I was happy, never complete
And so now, I hope you know
Because of that smile and your beautiful skin
I watch my eyes every day
And oh, the memory of that time
""I would do it exactly like this

[Chorus]
Because until now I saw love
Only in my dreams
But now it had finally come my way
It all turned out to be so much closer
I'll never forget it
Because suddenly, there you were

[Bridge]
Sweet to me
Gray clouds disappear
From then on I follow where you go
My heart should never have shone like this
You showed me that it all exists

[Chorus]
Yes until now I saw love
Only in my dreams
And now it had finally come my way
It all turned out to be so much closer
I'll never forget it
There you were
Yes yes you
Baby, you
Yes you"

Let me tell you what grows in me after a few years of living with you
I'll put it in the fine words that you must understand, what's brewing in me
'Cause you and I were once a couple until you screwed me, fuck it's over now
Oh everything you've done my trust to the moon I want you to go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You look at me like the world is ending
And that's true, yes
Because you don't know half what I've been through
But it is now ready
You hypocrite

[Chorus]
I've had it with your bastard
A lousy guy, you're nothing more than that
I'm sure now, you're not who I thought you were
Because you have only brought lies
One after the other and nothing more than that
I'm sure now, you're not the man for me

[Verse 2]
Your lips that I kissed, your hands warm and soft, that beautiful smile, it made me happy
And now the time has come, terrible but true
You don't love me enough
Given and taken for years, blows taken and deceived
That is also who you are
I should have known, it was a thing for a long time, but you know what it is?
It never gets used to

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You look at me like the world is ending
And that's partly true, yes
Because no one knows what I've been through
But it is now ready
Oh, you hypocrite

[Chorus]
I've had it with your bastard
A lousy guy, you're nothing more than that
I'm sure now, you're not who I thought you were
Because you have only brought lies
One after the other, nothing more than that
I'm sure now, you're not the man for me

You're not that man for me
You're not that man for me

I've had it with your bastard
You lousy chappie, you are nothing more than that

""I get confused and sometimes lost
And it doesn't stop
Because the world keeps on screaming
Rotating on its own axis
But I don't know what for

And I miss myself in everything I do
And I want it back but wouldn't know how

[Chorus]
Black is the sky
You make me
In a curse and a sigh
In something I don't want to be
I wish with the moon
To go down together

[Verse 2]
So I stay still and I listen to black and white
I feel the sun from the past
In which I played carefree as a child
Until night falls
Clear and pure as glass
And think back to when everything was still radiant

[Pre-Chorus]
God I miss myself in everything I do
And I want it back but wouldn't know how

[Chorus]
Black is the sky
Because you make me
In a curse and a sigh
In something I don't want to be
I wish with the moon
To go under

And I'm calling and screaming inside
And nobody hears it
I can't say it

Always by my side
Is the emptiness in me

Anouk,Ver Weg Van Jou,,,"Lyrics of Anouk - ""Far Away From You""

[Verse 1]
Your first smile, that first step
It looks like it was yesterday
I'll let you go, alone for the first time
So many things go through my mind
And even though the distance becomes great
No sea is too rough and the road is too high

[Chorus 1]
Because when I look at you
I see myself in you
My dear son, you don't know
How much I love you
With both eyes closed
I kiss your head
""I feel rich while you're still here with me

[Verse 2]
And what I sometimes said
Or what I did
It sometimes upset you
I just ask that you never forget
That my heart saw that way back then
It wasn't always meant to be
And I hope you have felt safe

[Chorus 2]
Because when I look at you
I see myself in you
My darling, you don't know
How much I love you
With both eyes closed
I hold you tight
""I feel rich while you're still here with me
While you're still here with me

Far from you, follow your heart
I will miss you
A new start, see you soon
I love you"

When the war comes
And if I have to hide
Can I be with you?
When a club comes
Which I don't want to belong to
Can I be with you?
If there is a rule
Which I cannot meet
Can I be with you?
And if I have to be something
Which I've never been
Can I be with you?

May I take shelter with you
If there is nowhere else to do it?
And when I have to cry
Will you dry my tears?
Because if I may be with you
Can you always stay with me
Come when you want
I'll keep a room for you

When the thunder comes
And if I'm afraid
Can I be with you?
When night falls
And it is too dark for me
Can I be with you?
When spring comes
And when I am in love
Can I be with you?
When love comes
And I am sure
Can I be with you?

May I take shelter with you

And nobody does what they promised you
Then I'll hold you until you believe
How much I love you
When it is night and the sky is closing
I show you in full light
When I kiss the tears from your face
How much I love you
I know you still can't believe
That there is an end to the pain
But like a flame that cannot go out
Am I there, and I will always be there
If you think no one really knows you
And you never get used to this world
Then I'll hold you until you recognize
How much I love you
I know you still can't believe
That there is an end to the pain
But like a flame that cannot go out
Am I there, and I will always be there

I will do anything for you and I live for your love
And I got that love, and often in excess
You could leave the barriers of life to me
You saw those girls hating because I had my superhero
You had told your friends about me just too many times
Now we are staring at the table together with our mouths closed
Looks that speak for themselves in our faces
I've done most of everything
But I drive too long in this tunnel and I don't see any light
So close your eyes for our final set
And think back to the little house with the small bed
Shit ... but tomorrow the pain will be back
When we are at the stop for hours, the train returns

[Chorus]
It takes too long
We've been here for a while
And we have to go on for the last time, I'm sorry
It takes too long
It takes too long
We stand still
What you want, what I want
It takes too long

[Verse 2]
Two quiet people at the table, it is not a sight
I can't walk that route with my eyes closed
You know exactly what I'm going to say, I know about you too
And in the end I'll tell you how much I love you
And then the doors slam again and another glass breaks
Then another tear falls and I pick up my bag again
And .. then I will hold you tight again
And put my clothes back in the closet
So I'll hold you for a little longer because then you'll forget how angry you were
But the pain stays so it doesn't help
So it will probably be the same song again tomorrow
The lyrics come down to the same thing in the same beat
Some kind of gold paint on a block of grief
Conflict is normal but it shouldn't suffocate us
My tears don't fall so I let the song sob

[Chorus]
It takes too long
We've been here for a while
And we have to go on for the last time, I'm sorry
It takes too long
It takes too long
(We stand still)
(What you want, what I want)
It takes too long"
Maan de Steenwinkel,Hij is van mij,,,"Lyrics by Kris Kross Amsterdam, Maan & Tabitha - ""He Is Van Mij"" ft. Bizzey

[Verse 1: Moon]
For the first time in my life
Can I give anyone anything
I feel safer with him
Yes he has everything I'm looking for
I keep him extra close to me
Because all those girls watching
But he doesn't give me any doubts

[Pre-Chorus: Tabitha, Moon]
You don't understand what I want with him
Please stop wasting your time
You're confused, he belongs to me
That's not what he said to me

[Chorus: Moon & Tabitha, Tabitha, Moon]
He's mine
He says I am everything to him
That I know him the best
That he thinks of me every moment
He's mine
It doesn't matter what you thought of me
Girl, don't you know he's waiting for me?
I do it best every night
He's mine

[Verse 2: Moon & Tabitha]
He's it for me
No other has it
Nobody can do better how he feels me
He takes me by, know better
He's got my heart, I say it every day
I say it every day

[Pre-Chorus: Tabitha, Moon]
You don't understand what I want with him
Please stop wasting your time
You're confused, he belongs to me
That's not what he said to me

[Chorus: Moon & Tabitha, Tabitha, Moon, Bizzey]
He's mine
He says I am everything to him
That I know him the best
That he thinks of me every moment
He's mine
It doesn't matter what you thought of me
Girl, don't you know he's waiting for me?
I do it best every night (Uh, uh, ey, ey, Bizzey)
He's mine

[Verse 3: Bizzey]
Ey, you're nagging me, mama
Look at me in my eyes
If you don't believe me mama (Ey, ey, ey)
So what does all this mean?
I find it hard to say what it feels like
That there is nothing else I miss, no
Protecting you, that's my goal
Courtois on that bitch, I don't miss anything
I like make up sex, but this is going too far, uh
We don't need to go there (Ooh)
You don't wanna go there

[Bridge: Tabitha, Moon]
Moon it's mine, oh
Not yours but mine, oh
Tabitha it's mine, oh
Just mine

[Chorus: Moon & Tabitha, Tabitha, Moon]
Just mine
He says I am everything to him
That I know him the best (He's mine)
That he thinks of me every moment
He's mine
It doesn't matter what you thought of me
Girl, don't you know he's waiting for me?
I do it best every night
He's mine

[Outro: Moon, Tabitha, Moon & Tabitha]
Alone, only mine, oh
He's mine
He's mine
I do it best every night
He's mine"
Tino Martin,Zij weet het,,,"[Lyrics of ""She Knows It""]

[Verse 1]
The moon is high in the sky
She tells me, ""You have to get out again""
And she is right
The city stares through the windows
She tells me, ""Are you coming out again?""
So I'm going right, hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
A Patta-jacka, a little too little money in my pockets
But that does not matter
That doesn't matter today
Outfit blacka, a little too little money in my pockets
But that does not matter
That doesn't matter today

[Chorus]
Because after all, I have earned this
She knows (She knows)
After all, I've earned this (She knows)
She knows
Because after all, I have earned this
She knows (She knows)
After all, I've earned this (She knows)
She knows

[Verse 2]
Run for the club, watch
Far too long ago people say
And they are right
The gate opens for a moment
I no longer have to buy a ticket here
And they are right

[Pre-Chorus]
A Patta-jacka, a little too little money in my pockets
But that does not matter
That doesn't matter today
Outfit blacka, a little too little money in my pockets
But that does not matter
No, it doesn't matter today

Because after all, I have earned this
She knows (She knows)
After all, I've earned this (She knows)

Because after all, I have earned this

After all, I've earned this (She knows)
She knows it

[Post-Chorus]
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey

[Verse 3]
She will be in the kitchen tomorrow morning
Making breakfast for the warrior
And she is right
We enjoy together at the table
And she doesn't ask too many questions about yesterday
And she is right
Yes, she is right

[Chorus]
After all, I have earned this
She knows (She knows)
After all, I've earned this (She knows)
She knows
Because after all, I have earned this
She knows (She knows)
After all, I've earned this (She knows)
Yes, she knows

[Post-Chorus]
Hey-yeah
Hey
Hey Hey
Hey Hey

Because after all, I have earned this
And she knows"
Rob de Nijs,Banger Hart,,,"[Verse]
Oh, I'm richer than I ever dreamed
I have your love, you sleep next to me every night
But I fear every day that is yet to come
There is no heart more afraid than mine
I didn't even really like your looks
Even if there is no girl as beautiful as you
Look at those men looking at you all together
There is no heart more afraid than mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I want your love in black and white
I want more security than this
Because you are my jealous possession

[Chorus]
There is no more fearful heart, no more fearful heart than mine
It is no longer possible otherwise it will still turn against me
Then you pack up, say, ""You have your way - well it's over!""
No more fearful heart than mine
Scared, scared heart, scared, scared heart

[Verse 2]
I prefer you than my own sweet life
I love to eat, drink, just as much as you do
There is only one thing that I cannot really control
There is no heart more afraid than mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I want your love in black and white
I want more security than this
Because you are my jealous possession

[Chorus]
There is no more fearful heart, no more fearful heart than mine
It is no longer possible otherwise it will still turn against me
Then you pack up, say, ""You have your way - well it's over!""
No more fearful heart than mine
Scared, scared heart, scared, scared heart
Scared, scared heart, no more scared heart than mine
No more fearful heart than mine

[Verse 3]
But if you are scared or lonely
I instantly become a different person
I put my arms around you
And can comfort you like none
Comfort like no one!
There is no stronger heart, no stronger heart than mine
When you are low, I am high enough for both
What do you want then, I am your man and everything revolves around me
I can take it, let it beat, that frightened heart of mine
There is no stronger heart, no stronger heart than mine
When you are low, I am high enough for both
What do you want then, I am your man and everything revolves around me
I can take it, let it beat, that frightened heart of mine
There is no stronger heart, no stronger heart than mine
When you are low, I am high enough for both
What do you want then, I am your man and everything revolves around me
I can take it, let it beat, that frightened heart of mine"
Rob de Nijs,Malle Babbe,,,"[Verse 1]
You scour the streets
And follows the thief's trail
With bums and soldiers
Their caps on one ear
You lift your skirts
And smiles at every man
Who dares in the dark
What is not possible during the day

[Pre-Hook]
And at night
In the pubs here
Your name circulates
With the blond foamy beer

[Verse 2]
I know them one by one
The gentlemen of decency
I will never forget them
Like they do to you
How often do you have such a headline
Drunk, stupid and horny
Not pressed to your chest
Your body wet with his drool

[Pre-Hook]
And at night
In the pubs here
Your name circulates
With the blond foamy beer

[Chorus]
Silly Babbe bowl
Malle Babbe come here
Nice piece, silly girl
Nice animal with pleasure
Malle Babbe is round
Malle Babbe is blonde
A kiss on the mouth
Malle Babbe, your nice ass

[Verse 3]
And on Sundays in church
Then there is such a gentleman
Stiff as a wooden board
With nails in the head
To look in his sofa
A black sheet suit
For his sinful body
Afraid of the devil
And afraid of his wife
And economical a cent
Put in the bag
In this way he buys back his soul
And his decency
And you have to go back
Standing somewhere in the dark
As it should
But then the day will come
Then they ring the bell
Then you wear white flowers
And ribbons on your skirt
When we're together
Go out of church arm in arm
What will they watch then
I always think about that

[Pre-Hook]
And at night
In the pubs here
Your name circulates
With the blond foamy beer

[Chorus]
Silly Babbe bowl
Malle Babbe come here
Nice piece, silly girl
Nice animal with pleasure
Malle Babbe is round
Malle Babbe is blonde
A kiss on the mouth
Malle Babbe, your nice ass"
Maaike Ouboter,Dat Ik Je Mis,,,"[Verse 1]
You kiss me, you sooth me
Embrace me, rest me
You catch me, you want me
Infinitely deprived me
You call me, you hear me
You save and disturb me
Believe me, rob me
Suffocate and numb me
You breathe and live me
Shivers and trembles me
Trust me, consider me
As a human being and restrains me
Of angry dreams
Who show up
The lonely questions
Of finite happiness

[Verse 2]
With your curls like night
How you talk how you smile
How your voice so close
As an angel softens
Flow in my dreams
Infinite emptiness
You slow me down, you tame me
You stir and move me
I miss you, I miss you
I grab you, I grab you
I want you, play you
I stir and command you
To stay with me
In dark nights
Not to yearn anymore
To you

[Verse 3]
Let me go
I have to go alone now
And hold me if you need to
In my mind and I'm looking for you
In everything around me
But I think sometimes
That it is better this way
Can't help it
Sometimes I miss you

[Verse 4]
Oh I smother you, you froze
Deliver and you lost
Way to another place
But I hear you
Embrace yourself, warm yourself
I see and I feel you
I pet you, I caress you
I hug and cuddle you
You drive me understand me
Confuses and misleads me
It sometimes scares me
How much I look like you now
My smile my tears
My love, my experience
I'm sorry about everything
Come help and set me free
And let me go
I can do it alone
But hold me if you need to
In mind and I find you
In everything around me
But I think sometimes
That it is better this way
Can't help it
Sometimes I miss you

[Outro]
I kiss you, I suspend you
I extinguish and I extinguish you
You stay very close to me
But you rest in my head"
BLØF,Harder Dan Ik Hebben Kan,,,"[Verse 1]
Your showers stain
To my snow-white mood
Got my hands on your hips
But my head is at the door
They say get used to it
I've tried it
But however I turn or turn it
My house no longer protects

[Chorus]
It's raining harder than I can handle
Louder than I can drink
It's raining harder than the ground can handle
Harder than I can handle

[Verse 2]
Your showers are the clouds
To my sky-blue mood
I've got my hands on your hips
But my head is at the door
Your eyes remain gray
Deny any color
It's as if no one lives here
As if nothing is happening

[Chorus]
It's raining harder than I can handle
Louder than I can drink
It's raining harder than the ground can handle
Harder than I can handle

[Verse 3]
Your moods are too dark
For my sky blue mood
Because my head is in the clouds
And my hand already at the door

[Chorus]
Harder than I can handle
Louder than I can drink
It's raining harder than the ground can handle
Harder than I can handle

It's raining harder than I can handle
Louder than I can drink
It's raining harder than the ground can handle
Harder than I can handle"

What would you do if I fell to the ground in front of you
What would you do if I did
What would you do if I took your face back in my hands
What would you do if I got my mouth close to yours
What would you do if I did (Well?)
Would you laugh, would you curse?
Would you say I'm an asshole
Would you cry, would you curse
Would you say you don't know me anymore
Would you laugh, would you scold, with grief
What would you say if I told you about all this time
What would you say if I said: I really don't regret all this time

De Dijk,Als Ze Er Niet is,,,"Ten to one that I shut up
When I see you again
I know myself so by now
I am not a talker
How was it here
You will ask
And I will say
Good
But I'm not telling you what I'm thinking right now
That I should actually tell you

A man does not know what he is missing
Don't know what he's missing
Don't know what he's missing
A man does not know what he is missing
But if she's not there
If she is not there
Only a man knows what he is missing

You talk about how it was
About how you talked
And maybe when I'm on a roll
I say once baby
Then you ask me
How was it with you
At most I say
Quiet
And again I am not telling you what I think now
That I finally want to tell you

A man does not know what he is missing
Don't know what he's missing
Don't know what he's missing
A man does not know what he is missing
But if she's not there
If she is not there

Not until you're not here
Now I feel it in me
Now that you don't hear me
I feel it word for word

A man does not know what he is missing
Don't know what he's missing
Don't know what he's missing
A man does not know what he is missing

If she is not there
Only a man knows what he is missing"
De Poema's,Houten Hart,,,"[Verse 1]
My heart is not made of stone
A case of pure wood
It was the best I could find
When someone left with the gold
My heart is made of the hardest wood
But it still bends if it has to
But not too far and take it easy
I don't really know what it does yet

[Chorus]
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies before you have already made it harder
So be nice
It will not hurt
And stealing doesn't seem worth it

[Verse 2]
You can let it walk well
Then it doesn't hurt that much
As when I still had the original
The gold, gold but small
This heart, I just bought it
Consciously a second-hand
You don't keep buying gold
Even though you had the chance

[Chorus]
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies before you have already made it harder
So be nice
It will not hurt
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies before you have already made it harder
So be nice
It will not hurt
And stealing doesn't seem worth it

[Bridge]
The advantage of a wooden heart
You are more careful with fire
The splinters are for others
There is no need for a lock and is therefore not expensive at all
My wooden heart
My wooden heart

[Chorus]
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies before you have already made it harder
So be nice
It will not hurt
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies before you have already made it harder
So be nice
It will not hurt

My wooden heart
This is my heart

This is my heart

De Poema's,Zij Maakt Het Verschil,,,"She's not a cure for the ticking of the clock
No hope, no guide
No port at night
No source in the desert
When you're thirsty
Not the smile at your worst joke

She's not a hit chorus
That sounds from the scaffolding
Not the most expensive wine
That you drink without a hangover
Not a flower garden in bloom
Not one night in a thousand
Not an outstretched hand
Not the end of all my waiting

No, more so that I actually want to admit
She makes the difference

She's not a lame excuse for what I would have liked to be
No dream, no goal
Not a stick to hit with
No guarantee of a long happy life
It is not an answer to the question of our existence
Not the most beautiful symphony among the movie called the two of us
Not the clean cool bed that can take away my fevers

Not the beat of my heart
Not the clearest conscience
She didn't come at the right time
And I don't care either
Because even more than I want to admit
She makes the difference

Between everything I had and how it suddenly came to life
What is sketched in pencil
Can be drawn in color
Between never going on and experiencing everything
Between never and maybe very sometimes
Between me and us

So many singers, so many words
And it must all be said
But whatever they try
No comparison is right
Maybe it is a bit simple
But all I want to hear is
She makes the difference
She makes the difference

Because she is not a good conversation that no dog is waiting for
Not the flag I'm fighting under
No advice for all my complaints
Not the very last way out that we have not thought of for a long time
But even more than I want to admit
She makes the difference
She makes the difference"
De Poema's,Zitten voor de blues,,,"I already know what's to come
And my God how hard it is
It's really unstoppable now
Sand in my heart
I'll sit down tonight
And do all the wrong things
Drink me completely
To be able to sing the blues

It usually comes when things go well
It usually comes after the intoxication
At every start of every success
Scour the sand off old blues
It's too great a sum
From pain through months
Walked on for way too long
Far too long and too alone

So I'm going
Sit for the blues
Sand in my heart
I must die, but not die
Twice as hard
Sand in my heart

And then I sit down again
And then I'll just force it
With lots of booze and dead pictures
And sing bad songs
And drink for those tears
Who have waited too long
I have to drown the pain now
Tonight is now or never

So I'm going
Sit for the blues
Sand in my heart
I must die, but not die
Twice as hard
Sand in my heart"
Acda & de Munnik,Niet of nooit geweest,,,"I see two people on the beach
Close to the water, hand in hand
The sun is setting, they are silent with happiness
I just met her because that's you
She smiles at him, he looks like me
But that is not possible, because I destroy everything
I can never be that boy, can I?
That rest, that love, nothing for me
But why does it seem so familiar?
I love you, as you can see
But something is not quite right here
I'm wearing a ring but ... I never married you ...
I am not myself
Or never been in all those years
I am the pacemaker at the wrong party
I have never or never been myself
I have never or never been myself
I see two people, they stand
She turns, we have to go
Look into my eyes and see the same pain
Two people connected before
All that falling in love, what a sin
We are both but don't want to be
I am not myself
Or never been in all those years
I'm the shoemaker with the wrong one
is reading
I have never or never been myself
I have never or never been myself
Oh let it be the sun (let it be the sun)
Oh, let it be the beach
Let it be the sea
Let me do something now
Which makes you never want to see me again
Oh let it be the salt (let it be the salt)
Let it be my worst mistake
But never let me forget this
Never forget again
Never let me forget this, besides

Where were you
When I called you
You told later
It was in town with friends
There was something else
A party and there you would have been
Then what did you do
When you heard me
I bothered you
In your game of the butterfly in the night
You said too softly: 'Don't, now just sleep'
And a kiss
And I know I will not claim you
Wasn't going to make any problems
When the going got tough
And I know I would let you
I would never leave you
Never
But it got difficult
Got so difficult
Who ever expected that
But where did you go
When I waited expected you in my bed
I had set the alarm
Because you would come anyway
But where did you go
Where did you stay
Where did you stay
I'm going to break here
And I just wait
And you just laugh
Everything good
Everything good
I'm here anyway
I'm with you anyway
And we make love
Everything good
But where were you then
When I kissed you
Your dull eyes
Your sweaty cheeks kissed softly
I don't know what you were thinking
But what I think now
And what I can't do much longer
Love dear dear
Where are you then (3x)
Where, where are you then
Where are you then

She looks at you
The atmosphere suddenly becomes so serious

I don't understand, it was so beautiful, not normal anymore, everyone
Time can quickly destroy
All of life overhauled, looking for a dream story
And I search along and I feel bad
Have I lost it, or have I left something somewhere?
Tell me where
We continue to grow as far as you can call it that
We are growing further apart

It's late anyway
It's late anyway
What are we still doing here
It's late anyway

You just stay here
Then I will already go home

Your presence disappears
My world is just getting smaller
Only through stubbornness
What we forget when swearing
On the grind of so many years
That we whine, that we whine
But in the same language

It's late anyway
It's late anyway
What are we still doing here
Come on, let's go to my house

Never having to be jealous
Love to open your mind
An ocean
How good would it be

Was there anything I wished for
Before the well ran dry
Then it was long they will live
Family that I love a lot
And for whom I would die

An ocean to hide in
Never have to be alone again
I've begged not to cry anymore
Please
Life is no longer frightening
I've had to crawl this far already
The last part will also go
Until I stand up

An ocean to escape to
Never having to be jealous
Love to open your mind
An ocean

Some day or what to be a hero
Now let the other one crawl
An ocean
Full of tears is mine

Now you never have to put on your coat again
And to hope your light works
Let the storm wind rage in the dark outside
Because inside it is warm and light and good
Look outside hand in hand where the rain falls
I see the fire of hope and doubt in your eyes
And I know your deepest fear

Because you can't know for sure and everything will pass
But I believe [5x]
In you and me

And when you get up in the morning, I'll be with you
And maybe I've already made some tea
And when the sun is shining outside we will walk through the dunes
And when it rains we go back to bed
Wake up slowly for hours, floating through time
I see the light through the curtains
And I know, the past is no certainty

Because you can't know for sure and everything will pass
But I believe [5x]
In you and me
I believe [5x]
In you and me

I turn off the lights and the room gets dark now
A street lamp outside gives some light
And the things in the room become friends who go to sleep
The chairs are waiting for breakfast
And tomorrow I wake up to the smell of bread and honey
The shine of golden sunlight in your hair
And the things in the room, I say goodnight
Tonight we'll go to sleep and we'll see tomorrow
But the things in the room would be lifeless things without you

[Chorus]
Because you can't know for sure and everything will pass
But I believe [5x]
In you and me
I believe [5x]
In you and me
Because you can't know for sure and everything will pass

Boudewijn de Groot,De vlinder,,,"To die on the water with your paper wings
Just float, after flying in the clouds you float here
With your colors fading
Without searching without questions
Finally rest forever
And the flowers you kissed
Colors that you have known
You can forget everything now
You rock back and forth on the water
To die on the water with your paper wings

Like a butterfly that can fly into the blue sky
Like a butterfly, always free and on the run from life
I want to die on the water
But that's a concern later on
I want to fly like a butterfly now
On the flowers, blisters fly
But I can't get that high
So I just fly in my dreams
I am always on the run from life
Like a butterfly that can fly into the blue sky

To live I thought you should be a butterfly
To fly very far away from all life and all pain
But I no longer suffer from jealousy of a butterfly
If even butterflies are to die I will not let my joy be spoiled
I can live without flies
What more could I give
About a butterfly that has drowned in me
I really don't have to be a butterfly to live"
Jan Smit,Ik zing dit lied voor jou alleen,,,"One day told my dear grandmother
That she set out all alone
For her very last trip
To a very beautiful paradise
She then said sweet boy
When I get there
Then you still sing your song to me
Because then I don't feel so alone
I'm singing this song for you alone
Bring white roses for you
Oh dear grandmother I love
It's so lonely here without you
I sing this song to you over and over
And dry my tears over and over again
Oh dear grandma, I love you
Yours, yours
Staying at grandma's house with all my friends
What a beautiful time that was
We played scrabble and Yahtzee
And my grandmother always participated
And we sang together, the most beautiful songs
That grandmother knew from yesteryear
But her beautiful voice no longer sounds
I'm singing this song for you alone
Bring white roses for you
Oh dear grandmother I love
It's so lonely here without you
I sing this song to you over and over
And dry my tears over and over again
Oh dear grandmother
I love you
Yours, yours
Yours, yours"
Willy Sommers,Laat de zon in je hart,,,"A smile, a greeting, a happy face
A bird floating towards the light
Oh it seems so normal but it's a miracle nonetheless
A child who smiles and waves to you
A cyclist who turns the corner
Oh it seems so normal but it's a miracle nonetheless
Life passes so quickly
That money for you but also for me ...

Oh let the sun in your heart
She still shines for everyone
Enjoy life
Because it only takes a while
Oh eat the sun in your heart
She still shines for everyone
Enjoy life
Because it only takes a while

The beach, the sea, the full moon
The sky where the stars are
Oh it seems so normal but it's a miracle nonetheless
And are you sometimes not well disposed
Think of a child's smile
Yes that makes you happy again, yes that makes you happy again
Life passes so quickly
That money for you but also for me ...

Oh let the sun in your heart
She still shines for everyone
Enjoy life
Because it only takes a while
Oh eat the sun in your heart
She still shines for everyone
Enjoy life
Because it only takes a while

If you are not happy you sometimes feel sad
Then think of the sun and sing this song

Oh let the sun in your heart
She still shines for everyone
Enjoy life
Because it only takes a while
Oh eat the sun in your heart
She still shines for everyone
Enjoy life
Because it only takes a while"
Danny de Munk,Ik Voel Me Zo Verdomd Alleen,,,"Get everyone out there
All of you fall dead for my part
I don't feel like learning well
I'll end up in the gutter anyway
Children don't want to play with me
They call me rat and point to me
The only one who cares
There never is, that's my dad

My mother cannot bear me
I never do anything right for her
I don't have to ask for love either
Swearing is all she does
No wonder my dad went sailing
I was not allowed, I am too small
I have to do it on my own
Until it ever returns

CHORUS:
If only I had someone to love
Two soft arms around me
Who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone

Maybe when Father's ship arrives
When it's back from the sea
He says again: listen Cis
Why don't you come with me?
I'm just a kid after all
Can't do it all alone
Maybe someday I will find happiness
But how, that's a big problem

CHORUS
If only I had someone to love
Two soft arms around me
Who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone

Who would always protect me
I feel so damned alone"
Gordon,Kon ik maar even bij je zijn,,,"1 thing I want from you to be what I am

1 thing I want from you to be what I am
And you become my wife if I look at you ff it is

Move your body and stay
Don't be so stiff

Keep on slime until I get to you
And then within a week with a new bowl
Well no okay what do you think hey ..,

Check your feelings for me with a kiss on your neck
And take you to my place
Dvd relax 1 can 1 place and then we go crazy
Because this cream has its floes
And is willing to do what you want to do
Have another drink don't need a thank you
1 for you and nothing to worry about

Gordon,Als alles wat je zegt waar zou zijn,,,"[Lyrics of ""Little Boy""]

[Verse 1]
As a very little boy, I had planned this for a long time
I drank a little wine, but a boy is not lamb
I want to talk to you, what I say will not take long
We can make some money together dude, tell me what you can
We drive real, real cars, crazy watch, yes, great value
I have to learn to save, really that shit is dangerous now
How we get all those bottles, how we pay for everything here
Shit, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey
I eat out every day, haven't cooked for years
But I'm thinking of more euros than hair on my head
And I'm not going to mention your name because then I'll make you too big
Lil 'Kleine, Ronnie Flex, we come out of the gutter together
What we do is not just like that, what we do is not just like that
We're from the bottom, motherfucker, no degree
I have to think about my future, I want balls like my grandpa
You guys who go bad because I make dough
I want you to be quiet, I don't want you to say anything
It's your boy 'Big Spend', everything here is real
My pupils are big, but I'm not going bad
And the club is already empty, but I'm not leaving
Talking to your sister under the influence of drugs
Sometimes I think about the past and want to go back
Smoke so much hash, get stoned when I cough
What would have happened if this had never happened?
Stop your hate, talk carat to me
Yes my outfit is too expensive, I can't wear you
Now I've made it what they say on the street
But I've only just started, yes, it's really going well, ey

[Verse 2]
It always failed to work, it always failed to work
Now a one, two, three back mortgage
No problem, no cunts
Rule one; don't rest
No, those chicks get nothing if they don't like lobster, ey
New Wave, new dough, I'm with a new ho
I listen to Hazes in the waggie at the studio
You act like you know, but you don't know anything
Your new mate is skeer, and he has nothing
You think it's strange, no buts
Take you here and there
Young stunner of the year
Bitch, eat caviar
I have a woman on my lap and she helps me count
I can call women for you and order women
I shit about who you are and all your fines too
I count my money when I smoke a really big horn
I'm not buying your new single because you're selling junk
I'm still the same, yes, that's the way I used to be
If this wasn't there I wonder where I would be
Was I still around with the boys in the square?
All those things with my mom still hurt me now and then
But my money is long and a boy is small
Ey, ey, ey

[Skit]
When the other classmates of mine listened to the latest hip-hop, I just started listening to André Hazes on my MP3, yes really"
Paul de Leeuw,Ik heb je lief,,,"K doesn't know if you're waiting
On a kind word from me
When I call you in mind
That makes me happy a lot
I feel it when I see you
If I just smell you
It's in a hundred thousand butterflies
Floating sweetly in my belly
I've loved you all my life
It's much more than loving
It's like you're in my blood
I can't live without you
Your beautiful eyes make me melt
Set me on fire like that
I only feel it at your sight
I also get it from Rotterdam
I love you, I love you, I love you
What should I do without you
it's four very small words
And although that scares you a bit
I love you for four seasons
I feel it a lot when you get up
Or after a summer shower
I've been getting week at the thought
You who are in my favorite sweater
It's my hand that you suddenly grab
When I ride happily next to you
It will come too, that's the crazy thing
Even through nothing at all
I love you, I love you, I love you
What should I do without you
it's four very small words
And although that scares you a bit
I love you, fourteen flower parades long
I taste it during our kisses
Or if you suddenly laugh
I see it in shooting stars
After heavy sex at night
It's that twinkle that breeze
Makes your all for me
I think when I see you walking like this
God, an angel passes by
I love you, I love you, I love you
What should I do without you
it's four very small words
And although that scares you a bit
I love you for a thousand and one nights
One of my best dreams
Is growing old with the two of us
May it come true
I love you even after the AOW
I love you
What should I do without you
it's four very small words
And although that scares you a bit
I love you, a hundred and four Christmas trees long
I love you, I love you
My whole life long"
Marco Borsato,Waarom nou jij,,,"If someone left me
Just swallow and move on
To turn and just get up again
It didn't affect me much

But I'm sad about you
Without you very insignificant
Your voice stuck in my head
Don't leave me alone for a moment

And that there are people who laugh
And that there are people who dance
And that there are people who kiss intensely
I can't understand that now

I only feel the pain of 'God, where is she?'
I just feel the pain of you missing here with me
And I can't handle it
I really can't handle it anymore

And I would like to beg
Want to beg you on my knees
If I knew it still made sense
But the days turn into weeks and the weeks turn into years

I cannot win this fight
Because you are way too deep inside
Why you, why you?
Why you?

Why are you out of my life here?
Why didn't you stay?
Why didn't you want to give me any more?
Why did you leave for no reason?

I hold you in my mind
I can still see you smiling at me
I miss your lips on mine
An image that will never disappear
Your hand no longer in mine

So I count the empty long days
That pass without you
With no hope for tomorrow
No hope for anything

But you
Will you still think of me sometimes?
Am I still with you sometimes?

I just count the long days
Just count the empty long days
But I do not want to
I do not want anymore

If someone left me
Just swallow and move on
To turn and just get up again
It didn't affect me much

But I'm sad about you
Without you very insignificant
Your voice stuck in my head
Don't leave me alone for a moment

And that there are people who laugh
And that there are people who dance
And that there are people who kiss intensely
I can't understand that now

I only feel the pain of 'God, where is she?'
I just feel the pain of you missing here with me
And I can't handle it
I really can't handle it anymore

Nanana ..."
Borsato,Afscheid nemen bestaat niet,,,"[Lyrics of ""Saying Goodbye Doesn't Exist""]

[Verse 1]
There is no such thing as saying goodbye
I will leave, but I will not leave you
My love, you have to believe me, even if it hurts
I want you to let go of me
And that you will continue tomorrow
But if you are lonely or scared
Then I'll be there

[Chorus]
Come like the wind you feel and the rain
Follow what you do like the light of the moon
Look for me in everything and you will meet me
Whisper my name and I'll be right there

[Verse 2]
See what is invisible, what you believe is true
Open your eyes and I'll be with you
All you have to do is take my word for it
There is no such thing as saying goodbye

[Chorus]
Come like the wind you feel and the rain
Follow what you do like the light of the moon
Look for me in everything and you will meet me
Whisper my name and I'll be right there

[Bridge]
Look in the sky, look at the sea
Wherever you will walk, yes, I will walk with you
Every step and every moment
Wherever you are
Ey-yeah-yeah-yeah
Whatever you do, wherever you go
Whenever you need me, just whisper my name
And I'm coming

[Outro]
There is no such thing as saying goodbye"
Volumia!,Hou Me Vast,,,"Nobody knows why the day turns to night again
Nobody knows why the sun is still shining
Nobody knows why the chilly wind would still blow
But I know I love you

Nobody knows why stars are falling
Nobody knows why death follows us
Nobody knows why people sleep in the cold
But I know I love you

Hold me tight, put my head nicely on your shoulder
Hold me, gently stroke my hair
Hold me, sometimes it all just gets too much
And being with you is all I want

Nobody knows why happiness sometimes blows away
Nobody knows why a flower fades
Nobody knows why you are the only one I trust
But I know I love you

Hold me tight, put my head nicely on your shoulder
Hold me, gently stroke my hair
Hold me, sometimes it all just gets too much
And being with you is all I want

Don't ask me, don't tell me, put your arms around me
Don't talk to me, hold me tight
Words fail when I pour out my heart to you
Don't talk to me, hold me tight

Hold me tight, put my head nicely on your shoulder
Hold me, gently stroke my hair
Hold me, sometimes it all just gets too much
And being with you is all I want"
Volumia!,Afscheid,,,"Always together
My arms around you
My greatest love
I really knew that immediately
The last few weeks, the days passed quickly
Farewell comes close
It will be difficult

Say you don't have to go baby
That you really had enough of me
Say you don't have to go baby
Go baby, because you have to
I know you have to

If possible, I would stay one more night with you
If possible, I would stay one more night with you
Then I would say I'm waiting for you
And that the future smiles at us
Then I would say for the umpteenth time
I don't want anyone else ever again

The suitcases are already outside
The tailgate slams shut
One last long kiss
In the early morning light
You look at me sweetly
And grabs me tight
I whisper in your ear that I will not forget you

Say you don't have to go baby
That you really had enough of me
Say you don't have to go baby
Go baby cause you have to
I know you have to

If possible, I would stay one more night with you
If possible, I would stay one more night with you
Then I would say I'm waiting for you
And that the future smiles at us
Then I would say for the umpteenth time
I don't want anyone else ever again

Never again will I feel what I feel for you
I hope I can live without you
Come on now, wipe away your tears, and remember very well
That I love you, love you

NO NO NO; you don't have to go baby, NO!
NO NO NO, you don't have to go baby, NO!"
