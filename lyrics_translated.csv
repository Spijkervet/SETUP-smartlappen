Andre Hazes,Kleine Jongen,,,"Little boy
You're in this world
So you will have to fight like me

I can know
Life is not easy
There is adversity at any time

Little boy
There are many good people
But there are bad, unfortunately it is true

You need only think
That you will soon realize
That honesty is the longest, believe me

This life passes
There is so little time, so live for you are free
But do it wisely, make people happy
Then you will truly be happy

Because life is so short
Many things are different when you get older
You're still playing with blocks but not for long
It's unfortunate but still not small

Little boy
At school, you will notice
It's all about numbers and power

So it 's life
So learn what you need to learn
Because then you know the one who laughs last

Little boy
If you later're great
Then your father might not

then tell
To your children
The wise teachings of your old man

This life passes
There is so little time, so live for you are free
But do it wisely, make people happy
Then you will truly be happy

Because life is so short
Many things are different when you get older
You're still playing with blocks but not for long
It's unfortunate but still not small

Little boy"
Andre Hazes,De Vlieger,,,"My son had birthday yesterday
He was eight years old, my darling
He asked me a kite
And he also had

To his ball, his bike, his trains
No, he looked to
Because his pilot had it all
Only I did not know why

And then the next morning, he said:
""Father, do you?
The wind is favorable
So I take my kite along ""

In his one hand a kite
In another letter
I could not understand it
But when my son said sweetly

I have a letter for my mother here
Which is high in the sky
This letter I tie on my kite
Until she receives him, I miss it

And when they read how much I love her
I can not get used to this other woman
I have a letter for my mother here
Which is high in the sky

I have a letter for my mother here
Those high in the sky
This letter I tie on my kite
Until they'm receiving, I miss it

I have a letter for my mother here
Which is high in the sky
This letter I tie on my kite
Until they'm receiving, I miss it

And when they read how much I love her
I can not get used to this other woman
I have a letter for my mother here
Which is high in the sky"
Andre Hazes,Eenzame Kerst,,,"I'm sitting here all alone celebrate Christmas
The punishment that I've earned I sit out
I shed for our family, but it still did not feel
Because you are celebrating Christmas with another
How could you forget me so quickly?
Why is there now another on my chair?
I'm so lonely here in this cold, cold cell
Can you really do not understand how I feel?
Now you're sitting at the Christmas tree with another
My children singing ""Silent Night""
Yes, it will shut 't for me certainly being
With nothing soothes my grief
My fellows got a package
The Christmas wish, ""Father, please come back home soon""
I got 'not mine, it gives me great grief
Not welcome in your own home
Perhaps I can give my children some
What issue the depths of my heart
I can not forget, so this Christmas song
A song so full of sorrow
For me it will not burn candles here
I feel like a tree without peak
I feel so alone, where I have to go soon?
In my mind I hear Christmas music
I'm sitting here all alone celebrate Christmas
The punishment that I've earned I sit out
I shed for our family, but it still did not feel
Because you are celebrating Christmas with another
Perhaps I can give my children some
What issue the depths of my heart
I can not forget, so this Christmas song
A song so full of sorrow"
Andre Hazes,Zij Gelooft In Mij,,,"[Verse 1]
She was sleeping
'K her last night early
""wait for me""
Maybe tonight I'm pretty used to
She nodded yes or
But she knows me (oh yeah)
Now I stand before you
I'm stuck back in the pub
Some night they don t, I've never enough
How was it?
That was all they asked (what she said)

[Chorus]
Because she believes in me
She sees a future for both of us
She never asks you free up even for me
Because she knows, this ignores
I write my own song
Until someone discovers me and see
That every one of my songs take
She trusts me, she believes in me

[Verse 2]
I would wait
Until the time that everyone recognizes me
And you can be proud of your own guy
On the streets they will say, You know, (oh yeah)
As long as we dream, the happiness
That somewhere on our guard
Then you forget quickly this night
You trust me, that is my strength
Oh my strength

[Chorus]
Because she believes in me
She sees a future for both of us
She never asks you free up even for me
Because she knows, this ignores
I write my own song
Until someone discovers me and see
That every one of my songs take
They trust me, they believe in me
(Ooohoohhoohooh)"
Andre Hazes,Geef Mij Je Angst,,,"You say: ""I am free"", but you mean, I'm so lonely
You feel crazy, you say, but I'm not dreaming
For those looks into your eyes say everything to me
I feel exactly as you do so you can be honest
You feel very good, you say, your mouth begins to vibrate
I think I can help you, but you have to like yourself
Each now a favor, that's all I ask
Put away that fear now, I already knew: it's my day
Give me your fear
I'll give you hope for return
Give me the night
I give you back tomorrow
As long as I do not lose
I think it really the road with you
Look at me now, no, say no, you are allowed to remain silent
'T Is still hard but I know I can get you
This never has to happen again if you stay with me tonight
Because then you will see if you think you will soon wakes up smiling
Give me a feeling
I hear it again now
I'm coming with you
Because I leave you now never go
Give me your fear
I'll give you hope for return
Give me the night
I give you back tomorrow
As long as I do not lose
I think it really the road with you
Give me a feeling
I hear it again now
I'm coming with you
Because I leave you now never go
Give me your fear
I give you dr hope for return
Give me the night
I give you back tomorrow
As long as I do not lose
I think it really the road with you
With you!
With you!
With you!"
Andre Hazes,Ik Leef Mijn Eigen Leven,,,"[Hook André Hazes]
I look back now, and yet I have no regrets
Those were great years
For what I did, I never did anyone harm them
It's my life
I live my life as I want
I surely do not meddle with another
I live my life as I want
Let me go now before I change

[Fresh 1 Sam J'Taime]
I'll take you into the life of a young man
That had to fight with no future plan
No emotion in her eyes, is not afraid of anyone
Has long been in jail since he was a man
He's since she twelfth all night long in Amsterdam
You were tilted when you arrived somewhere they route
He was abused by her mother, has already liters to bleed
Luck was really hard to find, was not firmly in her shoes
Her father was the powder, so he did not really better
No more feeling for women, she could not share feelings
Always a burden on her shoulders, yet he lives they live
Many backs in fines, he did not work so had to steal
Was not really in the books, but could gestrapt with nine
And I said, live my own life, no one stop me
Young reckless, which is itself still young at
Were they tears of books he had written a letter sah

[Hook André Hazes]
I live my life as I want
I surely do not meddle with another
I live my life as I want
Let me go now before I change

[Verse 2 Sam J'Taime]
I'll take you into the life of a young woman
A teenage mother who has entrusted rd heart early
But they never gave up, even though she was so broken
Family gescot dirty, so they became young adults
But came into the wrong hands, had nothing to strive towards
She was stubborn it was hard to give something
She stood Kinky because she did not really read books
She thought, I can not help me and child should eat
Nobody should they wish to interfere in rd one row
Her child was no shortage always walked with the latest shoes
Luck was hard to find but there is always hope
There is always a choice how you live also runs

[Hook André Hazes]
I live my life as I want
I surely do not meddle with another
I live my life as I want
Let me go now before I change"
Andre Hazes,Zeg Maar Niets Meer,,,"Say no more
I'll go away if you want
Say no more
Let me go
Now be quiet
Refr:
But this is the last time
I know you're looking down on me
But later when doing better
I hope you got state
Ah say nothing
I'll go away then you are free
Say no more
You had for months not mine
Refr:
But this is the last time
I know you're looking down on me
But if it goes better soon

I hope you got state
No. I do not see you standing
And say you better go
You told me I remain your faithful"
Andre Hazes,"Bloed, Zweet en Tranen",,,"[Verse 1]
I have done well
But if done wrong
When I look back
On time
A laugh with tears
So I feel today
Tasted Life
So many friends unprecedented

[Chorus]
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Rot here now but""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said, ""Friends, friends day, the cake is""

[Verse 2]
I've known happiness
Well known sorrow
How often
I bumped my head
Yet I am satisfied
With everything I am
If your fame is over
Look who else knows

[Chorus]
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Rot here now but""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said, ""Friends, friends day, the cake is""

[Bridge]
I've really seen
No, I have no appetite
I'm not mad that I still miss someone soon
I keep really only
Yes, really alone
No more whining in my head, oh crap now but

[Chorus]
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Rot here now but""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said, ""Friends, friends day, the cake is""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said ""Rot here now but""
With blood, sweat and tears
I said, ""Friends, friends day, the cake is"""
Andre Hazes,Sorry,,,"Sorry
What I want to say you are sorry
But you go away, it's over
Yes, really over
really over
Sorry
Yes, I must go
But I'm sorry
I know it might be hard
But I'm leaving
It is too late
Silence
It scares me that great silence
You were so busy, it's over
That is over, yes really beyond
Only you know what I care about you
I have lived for your
We remain friends
you only know that I love you
But it's too late, it's over

I have so much of your stuff
Can I keep them here with me

I will read every day
When I see your weather
See your weather
Only you know what I care about you
I have lived for your
We remain friends

But it's too late, it's over
Only you know what I care about you
I have lived for your
We remain friends
you only know that I love you
But it's too late, it's over
(C) André Hazes"
Andre Hazes,Waar Ben Jij,,,"Lost in a bleak past

With the pain of the present

Since you're gone

Is the rain appeared here

Where are you, where are you

Part of my life

You were so sweet and tender

When I shared the love with you

It is quiet and lonely

I do not think I can handle this

Where are you, where are you

I have so much to give

Our dreams are over, it's over

Only one memory

This is never good

I must forget you

And continue living

But life without you

That hurts

You're not replacing

It makes my heart just scared

The feeling when you held me

Your voice, so soft calls my name

Where are you, where are you

You are my life

I feel the tears burning

Word hysterical desire

I miss you so, I can not stand

Our dreams are over, it's over

Only one memory

This is never good

I must forget you

And continue living

But life without you

That hurts"
Andre Hazes,Laat Me Vrij,,,"Turn around
I want to ask you let me go
You look at me
I just want to be so truly free
I want nothing more
Nothing for you
It's really better this way
No it's been fun
I continue but without you
It is not
I do not want anymore
It reminds me already really not very
Let me free to let me go
Forget what we have done
Forget me
No no kiss
Before I go out the door here
It's so good
I'm not here because it must
It is over
Yes really over
I really feel nothing for you
No, it's like I was going on but without wife
It is not
I do not want anymore
It reminds me already really not very
Let me free to let me go
Forget what we have done
Forget me
Pacific Coast there is the door
Here you have the keys
Let everything stand
That's for you
It is not
I do not want anymore
It reminds me already really not very
Let me free to let me go
Forget what we have done
Forget me"
Andre Hazes,Ik Ben Daar,,,"I am there

If you really need me hard

Oooh, I'm there

Did you think that I forget

I am there

I will always fight for you

I fight me die for you

I'm there where you go

I am there

A shadow now falls on me

But I'm there

There will also be light again

I'm there as a thank you for all your love

What you have given me

I am there

I can not without you my darling

I am there

That, I believe, really deep in my heart

I am there

You know, I can not without you

I'm there, believe me

The day is coming

You trust me again

Believe me

I am there

I am there

I can not without you my darling

I am there

That, I believe, really deep in my heart

I am there

You know, I can not without you

I'm there, believe me"
Andre Hazes,Over En Uit,,,"I look at your face
And kiss your eyes
We got enough time in those days
I know your mouth, I know you laugh
But you rarely said what you saw
And the night was short for my questions
I listened so bad
To the voice of my heart
For me it was not a game
But for you it was though

Over and out, it's over
Over and out, it's over
You have deceived me boundless
You give nothing to me
Over and out, it's over
Over and out, I can not take it anymore
It has reached the point where I let you go
Over and out

You put your hand in mine
That moment remains with me
I can still see the tears in your eyes
You walked away from me
You explained to me
Why me all this time had lied
I did not believe what one of you said
But I know better now
Just go away, you are now free

Over and out, it's over
Over and out, it's over
You have deceived me boundless
You give nothing to me
Over and out, it's over
Over and out, I can not take it anymore
It has reached the point where I let you go

Over and out, it's over
Over and out, it's over
You have deceived me boundless
You give nothing to me
Over and out, it's over
Over and out, I can not take it anymore
It has reached the point where I let you go

Over and out"
Andre Hazes,Zie Ik Jou Maar Even,,,"It is night, it is cold
I will wait until you come home
I look up at your window
There are still no lights on
It's getting colder and chilly
My collar pulled high
Oh, what time you come home
I am so cold

I see you but equally
That I'm tevree
Then I go back home
Another hour TV
I see you but equally
Yes, I've had enough
I am happy again
Until tomorrow morning

Yes, I've been wrong
This should never have happened
Really, I feel so stupid
I did not expect this
It gbeurd, so sorry
This is not good to talk
It's too late, it's over
I stand in the cold

I see you but equally
That I'm tevree
Then I go back home
Another hour TV
I see you but equally
Yes, I've had enough
I am happy again
Until tomorrow morning

Now drop some drops
But that apparently belongs to
Oh, how long must I wait
Do you want to see, this is my moment

I see you but equally
Yes, I've had enough
I am happy again
Until tomorrow morning
Oooh"
Andre Hazes,Laat Mij Zo Leven,,,"You only live once in this world
So I make some of
I live the way I want
And I take what I can get
Let me say no more
That is past tense
I do what I want in all honesty

'T Get some time for myself
That was, I forgot
It's time for you and me
And that everyone should know
There is only one in one life
That hit me yet can
The rest may view it
I go my own way

Let me live like
Let me just go there own way
Let me live like
Because I can around the world

I sometimes sometimes things
I really must leave
But I will not complain
Because I feel good
I live one's own life
Whatever one thinks of
It is one's own life
Owh I do own one sentence

'T Get some time for myself
I had forgotten
It's time for you and me
And that everyone should know
Is the only one living in it still can get me
And the rest can view it
Because I'm going there own way

Let me live like
Let me just go there own way
Let me live like
Because I can around the world

That hit me yet can
The rest may view it
Because I'm going there own way

Let me live like
Let me just go there own way
Let me live like
Because I can around the world"
Andre Hazes,Diep In Mijn Hart,,,"It's sad to walk here in the rain
How often I walked with you through this street?
You were so young and so shy
We talked about getting married sooner or later

You told me to wait for you
I did not know but I remained faithful

Deep down in my heart
I know you're too young for me
Deep down in my heart
I suddenly knew that ignores

Deep down in my heart
A voice said: ""This is nothing for you
She is young, she knows nothing of faith
If she goes soon be too late ""

Now you're a woman who laughs at life
You make friends that I still subconsciously hate
I will never forgive myself this
It is as if love does not exist

I hope you find happiness with that person
It's my own fault, you can not do anything here

Deep down in my heart
I know you're too young for me
Deep down in my heart
I suddenly knew that ignores

Deep down in my heart
A voice said: ""This is nothing for you
She is young, she knows nothing of faith
If she goes soon be too late ""

Deep down in my heart
I know you're too young for me
Deep down in my heart
I suddenly knew that ignores

Deep down in my heart
A voice said: ""This is nothing for you
She is young, she knows nothing of faith
If she goes soon be too late """
Andre Hazes,Papa,,,"Here I am and I do not know what to say
And of all understand hij't
Later, perhaps it is redeemed
But later it still takes such a time

His little hand grabs my hand
Dad you going to leave us
Because there is a large suitcase down the corridor
You might not come back Mamma said

Chorus:
He squeezes me gently in my hand
Dad can I go with you
Then you do not miss me
And I'm never scared
We are always together with his two

Since I am shooting a lump in my throat
I lift him here at last
I am ashamed of my tears as he looks at me
Dad when I see you again

Chorus: x2

We are always together with his two"
Andre Hazes,Ik Hou Van Jou,,,"Why did you let me do so alone
For the first time I was number one tonight
You said ""I love you"" a thousand times
But now
I'm still alone again

Yet I know you already regret
Because you do not understand now
I love you so much
I never want another woman
Yeah, I just thought of you
I gave you love and faithfulness
You can think what you want, darling
I love you

It costs you do not bother
Because I'm nothing
An expensive Roll's for you
For me, an old bicycle
Forget what you've been self
Why why I'm alone again

Yet I feel you already regret, because now you do not understand
I love you so much
I never want another woman
You just gave me what I wanted
All your love and your faithfulness
You can think what you want, darling
I love you

Yet I feel you already regret
Because you do not understand now
I love you so much
I never want another woman
You gave me everything I wanted, all your love and your faithfulness
You can think what you want, darling
I love you"
Andre Hazes,Zoveel Jaren,,,"It seemed so easy maybe
To leave me
But you now have problems
Now let me go you good
And do not come whining to me
And do not lie to me
I've heard everything
What you did
So many years, so many years discarded
But bowing to you I never
Hand in hand we walked together
The whole world was ours
For you do not really matter
You went your own way
You know, I have many friends
Who saw what you did
You played but lost
Yes, you're lost everything
So many years, so many years discarded
But bow down to you, I do not
I let you go
But you're not done yet
You touched my heart
Yes, now your end, darling
So many years, so many years discarded
But bow down to you, I do not
So many years, so many years discarded
But bow down to you, I do not"

I can really live again believe me
Just believe me

Ref: 2x
Do not want to live on the street
Wants to return to normal zaols it comes
Try me just to live

I do not close an eye
It haunted me through my head
Am I crazy now

I had so much to say
But the words did not come
It is so confusing
I have such sorrow

Start over
I feel empty me, where can I go
The rain is pouring benee
Start over
I feel empty me, where can I go
It now looks as if it's raining
Just for me

Your decision has been taken
But the door is ajar
You or disappeared
But be in my heart you still here

Where once your pillows layers
There is now one
I can still smell as
Good night darling

Start over
I feel empty me, where can I go
The rain is pouring benee
Start over
I feel empty me, where can I go
It now looks as if it's raining
Just for me

Now there is nothing to share
Because you share your love out
Sometimes running life differently
Usually you who do not see
Because if you really love someone
Are you blind
Because if you really love someone
Are you blind

Start over
I feel empty me, where can I go
It now looks as if it's raining
Just for me"
Andre Hazes,De Glimlach Van Een Kind,,,"You are so wise that says a child
You are so gray that says a child
You're married, that says a child

You're getting really old man
But before you think, how well must
She grabs your hand and smiles at you

refr .:
The smile of a child
Makes you realize that you live
The smile of a child
It has a life ahead
That life is worth
Sometimes with some sadness
But with love, happiness and fun in the offing
The smile of a child
Playing with a train or a pop
Such a smile makes you happy
There can no longer compete with feast
What does it matter whether you get older
That still does not matter anymore
Because you feel happy
Even though you have no penny

Andre Hazes,Toe Laat Me,,,"I have nothing to lose
Nothing stands me in the way
Believe me
I nothing wrong
But believe me I know what I say to you

You, you wanted everything
No you never enough
Yes believe me it's over
I can make my world now, but I can do without you

I can go wherever I want
Well under clubs and restaurants
Jeans said no more
No thank you, but that hurt
'T is at
past

Delicious nothing to lose
No false friends at home
I hope that from now on always rains
Then the sun shines for me
Although I have nothing, I am free

TO LET ME!

Let me add ..."
Andre Hazes,Sterk Wil Ik Zijn,,,"[Intro]
Hey, we should really have to go, we'll go

[Verse 1: Rico]
I leave the house and hearth
My entire possessions to my skin and my hair
With a covered wagon and horses along ancient canals
Below the
Sassenpoort
 by for a chat and drink
D'r d r market is rubbish and I perish with the draw
So I go to McDonalds or recall
Pizza al Tonno
But nothing in life is
My meal is hot
Therefore, I take it and eats it in the park
In the park I see Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny
And that bottle
malt whiskey
 this sets the mood
I take a sip and salute the men and walk to my hideaway
Where I take blob on the couch and give Sticks Hand

[Verse 2: Sticks]
How is it going?
Sitting on a bench I park
Long Flying thoughts raked
Caricatures carts past a crate
Or rather a tray Hollandia is gesparkt
You see, wanderers are guests who hung
They feel lucy, spacend with diamonds
They provide the constinatie
Have seen the light, or maybe it's religious mania
Walking down the street talking to himself
Traffic controllers need to leave to skotoe
Walkers and footballers in other phases
Walkman on my head put it to stop and chat

[Verse 3: Rico]
We clap a tearjerker Andre Hazes
With my Mattie evening in the full moonlight
Besides the trunk awake as bakeries
It is unfortunate that the
Wezenlanden park
 no longer there
due to renovation
Therefore, wait until it is finished
But I've been waiting for another year
It is serving a sentence for guests in jail
But I hang on a park bench
And keep an eye on things as prison guards

[Hook: Bert Vrielink]
I sit on a bench, on the canal
The streets are flooded, no one laughs
The wind, imagines himself away from traffic
Langszwierend, the swoft and defense
Sand and leaves, veins streets through the city
Hear them whispering, I want to listen while

[Bridge: Stick]
Sitting on a park bench
Completely entranced people walking along
Visualize
Share my thoughts corridor
Everyone is the same, we are equal in rank
Every day the question
How do I do my dance
Draw my conclusions
Make it music
Share it with you
Come sit on the bench

[Verse 5: Rico]
Mom throws balls, dog after it
A koter falls to the ground and whining calls to his mom
Joggers in the rate of elderly
Jogging about the studded with shells paths
In the grass a young couple to sew
I can guess;
The park is a paradise on earth
Both with a hangover and we talk about track
Ask for a rogue and picking Medium shag

[Verse 6: Sticks]
We took advantage of everything on this place
I looked at my life from under me worn cap
I wrote mn lines
Usually at this site
We bought anything we put it in our training jacket
And everyone has that kind of tricks when it is young
Brats arrange anything in a few seconds
I hung with skaters with little tray with lager
Breakers at parties and meat on the grill

[Bridge: Stick]
Sitting on a park bench
Completely entranced people walking along
Vizualiseer
Share my thoughts corridor

And behind that door I was being
I knew you were there
But I started the worst fear
Because you were not alone
His image went through me
Yes, now I know why you went so fast
So I have not ever meant
No, I have not ever felt
No, I was talking not expect
Another in your home to share with you all night
So I have not ever meant
No, I have not ever felt
No, I was talking not expect
I beg you, send him away, I want to be with you all night
I listen to your door
And know that he's my whiskey drink
And you, you drink wine
That took you so cozy in 't sound
But you told me
Oh, is it over now?
Tonight there is another side to you
So I have not ever meant
No, I have not ever felt
No, I was talking not expect
Another in your home to share with you all night

Yet I remain your faithful

I need you always say, ""Honey, I love you""
I gave you everything you asked me
It is still only at home

How long this will last?

I hear you talking
What went through your head
Could you just leave me
Suddenly you were gone
Yes without a word
I thought you had it fine
I never heard anything
But dark clouds
They are gathering
And I look outside
See your face in the window
Minutes seem like hours
Days seem weeks
Why are you the charms
Those other succumbed
No. I'll never forget you
My thoughts are with you
Still, you left me alone
I still love so much
Days and nights
They fly past
If I look at your picture
Are you so close to me
No you is very deep
Deeply secure in me
And if you come back again
I will always care for you
We mention both
We do not have to talk
I hold you tight
To never let go to
Minutes seem like hours
Days seem weeks
Why are you the charms
Those other succumbed
No. I'll never forget you
My thoughts are with you
Still, you left me alone
I still so much you
Does my life have meaning
New chance new beginnings
Will not blame
Do not worry for that
Those days without you
They take way too long
Because you're still the one
I so wish
Minutes seem like hours
Days seem weeks
Why are you the charms
Those other succumbed
No. I'll never forget you

Give me a sign let me know what you feel
Maybe I can understand what you really mean
I know I can continue
Or have gone out of your heart
Tell me right now what I can do for you
I remember the day
You lay beside me for the first time here
You said to me
Feel happy and so free
Your hands through my hair
It was so beautiful you seemed so happy
But now you're cold and quiet here beside me
Chorus: 2x
Release me from my pain
Do this may not be true neeeeee

I'm excited
Nothing is too crazy for me
I'm good again away
And I hear a beautiful melody
For you dear I'm on my knee

Together on the beach
Running through the sand
No one will ever separate us
Enjoy the sun
On the horizon
Our love will stay
time stood still, but that's what I want
Every year I want this experience
What we have fun
Nothing is too crazy
You're where I live

I take you in my arms
I will hard heat
Can not live without you (can not live without you)
You are my senorita
We drink magaritha
Yes you're mine (he is for you yeah)
We are in a very distant land
And look at the light
Of the moon over the ocean
I want to go with you

Together on the beach
Running through the sand
No one will ever separate us
Enjoy the sun

I stand for the people I love so much

Go ahead sleep, turn off the lights but now out
I'm enjoying things here have to close here
Do not wait up, love, well you know how it goes
One more sip, one more song
And I'm like always stuck again late

In spite of the airs and gloss of the night
I know you're alone at home waiting for me
And any moment just is dreaming
Tonight is yours, you shall not prevail
No need, no people, nobody around us
And that will remain of us our time
I'm back for the people I love so much
But by every word that I sing I think every time you

So, go solid sleep, turn off the lights but now out
I'm enjoying things here have to close here
Do not wait up, love, well you know how it goes
One more sip, one more song
And I'm like always stuck again
So often, but always on the road
""K I wish you always had with me
But the shelves, waiting
The lights are on
Forgive me, darling, but I am sorry again

Go ahead sleep, turn off the lights but now out
I'm enjoying things here it until it closes here

Go ahead sleep, turn off the lights but now out
I'm enjoying things here have to close here
Do not wait up, love, well you know how it goes

It was in the rain
In the dark, late at night

You went with a guy
Who paid you for a night
Why could not I trust you?
I never had you just for me?
The love that you're looking at another
What I gave you was really sincere
Why could not you build?
Our love was not real?
How could I love you?
Will you ever regret
For you are all bad
You saw me in a mirror
You startled and fled
But to no avail
Because believe me when I say:
Our love is over
No, it does not love me
You have to believe me
It's over, really over
Why could not I trust you?
I never had you just for me?

Ideally I asked
Make you go along
Come fly with me on land and sea
The wind that brings us to the happiness
Without one goal of no return
But only with you
With you
Beneath my wings I gave you a home

What are you happy
Your own house
I have to travel often only gone
Without you
But I came back
You were too far away
Ideally I asked
Make you go along
Come fly with me on land and sea
The wind that brings us to the happiness
Without one goal of no return
But only with you
With you
The wind that brings us to the happiness
No return no turning back
But only with you
With you
With you"
Jannes,In Gedachten Fluister Ik Jouw Naam,,,"[Lyrics from ""My Son"" ft. Janne Schra]

[Verse 1: Fresku]
I do not know who I am with son
But I do not know who I am without you
I'm looking for a miracle, and I'm not losing
So we kneel and pray for a miracle now
Maybe I did not pray often enough
It's making me crazy, but I'm looking for a reason
State it so written? How many tears should I give?
How much should a father's heart can endure in this life?
But your power to make me fight as well strong
Never give your dad the courage
My heart as heavy as a brick
But since day one is your father remained cool
I pick up small little hand, he does not stop vibrating
Your eyes are closed, but your heart does not stop to
I post a message, ""Please people, do not stop praying""
And later thousands of loving messages
You're the proof, love brings people together
A few days, boy, many people think of you
They say my son did the will of his father
But I fear I break myself, never been afraid

[Pre-Chorus: Fresku]
I've never been so scared
But fighting for me, boy, is nothing more than your mind
I've never been so scared
But fighting for me, boy

[Chorus: Janne Schra]
Fight for your mother, your father fought for
Fight for love, fighting for the world
Fight for your life and not give up
You have to fight, my son
My son

[Verse 2: Fresku]
I hold my heart, watching your heartbeat
What would your chances as it was at the doctor?
My head which takes wrong turn
Became sick 's idea, and my heart broke
Light in my head, sometimes my hope is also to get away
Because nothing is promised except where you fight against
Fight for me, little prince, your journey begins
And now give you everything for gaining the greatest warrior
And we do not win without a fight
But great creator, I beg you, my children
Thoughts gloomy, secluded
All black and dark feel strapped me
Stay here with Dad, I can not do without
The world thinks you're all special now
Your mother whispers in your ear, she says, ""Wake up""
When I'm with your sisters, I have worn me great
And when I hide my eyes tears on the toilet
People start asking me a lot
And can not be strong if I have to talk about it
I tell your mother, ""I'm sure he has everything""
But I fear I break myself, never been afraid

[Pre-Chorus: Fresku]
I've never been so scared
But fighting for me, boy, is nothing more than your mind
I've never been so scared
But fighting for me, boy

[Chorus: Janne Schra]
Fight for your mother, your father fought for
Fight for love, fighting for the world
Fight for your life and not give up
You have to fight, my son
My son"

We looked at each other
We spoke of love
It was so beautiful
It seemed like a dream night

Luck was then close
I remember what she said
""I rely on you
Bring me now home soon ""

It's gone so fast
What I have through my fault

The parting does every pain
You would love to be with that person
What remains are thousands of beautiful dreams
But your heart is in the last train
See the tunnel you lighten
Far to the pearly gates
There you again recognize faces

A new opportunity, but what should I do?
It makes no sense
Come dance with me the tango of love
Come dance with me tango amor
Toe stay with me because you are my whole life
What you do, I want to be close to you
Deep in thought, I hear it again
Warn me again and again that voice
Let her go, you do not deserve this
She smiles at every guy
But the feeling for me is my pain
All she does me such grief
I miss her warmth and tenderness
I want to see her ever again
Come dance with me the tango of love
Come dance with me tango amor
Toe stay with me because you are my whole life
What you do, I want to be close to you
In any love song you come over
Why do I have a lot more of you and you love me
Toe stay with me because you are my whole life
What you do, I want to be close to you
What you do, I want to be close to you"

The Opposites,Sukkel in de liefde,,,"[Verse 1: Willy]
Six o'clock in the morning, deserted town
Call for a booty call, but nobody wants to hear r
Walk past the house of my ex
Ideally I'm with her, but the thought makes me crazy
So I like a taxi
See my sunken cheeks in the mirror
Went too hard lately

[Hook: Willy & Twan]
Sucker for love, King in the disco
Surrounded by chicks that want to hang out for the fame (suspended for the fame)
Swarm like fokking snakes around me
Tears roll down my heart so to benee
I love my pain hidden, so I laugh with them
They want to hang out for the fame (suspended for the fame)
It's actually not surprising
I'm a sucker for love, King in the disco

[Verse 2: Twan]
You said your heart was broken, right?
And that's why I gave you mine
I loved him anyway for myself?
If I knew you would disappear along
Now I walk around in an empty house
Only a mirror that looks at me
Black hole in my soul that sucks me
again collides with the city to silence
Full pride, my chest out
I do not miss you, I do not miss you, I miss you not
Yet, every step forward is related to you, you did not know
Make no mistake, I have some bad bitches hiero, and every night might be one cause I'm a

[Hook]
Sucker for love, King in the disco
Surrounded by chicks that want to hang out for the fame (suspended for the fame)
Swarm like fokking snakes around me
Tears roll down my heart so down
I love my pain hidden, so I laugh with them
They want to hang out for the fame (suspended for the fame)
It's actually not surprising
I'm a sucker for love, King in the disco

[Verse 3: Mr. Probz]
One more before the sun comes up, the nights are getting longer
Feel all slip out of my hands
The same song again and I hear nothing else
One more time before the sun rises, nights grow longer
By myself in a room full of people

[Hook]
Sucker for love, King in the disco
Surrounded by chicks that want to hang out for the fame (suspended for the fame)

I take a sip of that Liqa because we come off tonight
If they call, we are not there, because tonight I hang on
It's late but I'm not ready I have a bubbly and a cup. My head is zweefie by which Liqa put it down and pick it up
Would not all my time get waxed
But since you could [?] Party pull up'm there at your party
Do not respond to your messages, but you know I read
All these ladies have nothing on me
So go along and get free tonight
The only thing on my mind is you, because you're the papito want nothing more

[Chorus]
Baby you're so fine I want you to kiss me [?]
I'm sure this must be

are you coming this evening
In our favorite restaurant?
A table for two
I called
They know it
And we drink
Until the sun comes
And we forget
The unfairness of fate

Tell me it is not so

Let's go
Put on your coat
Otherwise it will be too late
Come here, I hold you, I'll never let you go
And I tell you a joke that makes you cry with laughter
And we forget the eyes of the people in the city

We pretend it is not so
As if it is not so
As if it's not true

We pretend they just continue living
Like she just lives on
Even if it is not so"
Frank Boeijen,Vaderland,,,"It is fair in hell

Now that I think of you so far away
Where it rains in the water
A man kneels in the mosque
And somewhere a rooster is crowing

And everyone wakes
A mother washes her child
In the foaming water
The fishermen go back
With stories for later

Frank Boeijen,Als Schelpen In Het Zand,,,"And the wind blows
The thoughts away
The turtle drinking tears
The country so far

Where the father is gone
Beyond the horizon
Like a swallow ascended
He left with a smile

In the night he appears
The eyes open so wide
In the morning he disappears
The rays of the sun

It's written in my heart
That long last day
When we were back together
If shells in the sand

The monk expresses his prayers
For the restless soul
Who can not find the sky
By can not see the clouds

There are countless questions
Written in the air
If the wind is blowing
The answer comes back

All that is described
The water in the fire
If the fear is gone
In the last hour

It's written in my heart
That long last day
When we were back together
If shells in the sand"
Frank Boeijen,Gras,,,"I lost my mother a hundred times
in dreams
in winters
A stone city
Other children born of her
And father
Trembling had loved

But a hundred times
I won her back
Sprawled over in just green grass
It breathed and labored or ill
Rippled like a song
And wavy was forever

Be gentle
Be endlessly
One and all arms
grass Mother
mother Grass
trembling compassion

Behind us, the people sky red
The clouds sailing
The birds hover
Teach me too much to live with a heart
Until I can clear both in your lap

But a hundred times
I won her back
Sprawled over in just green grass
It breathed and labored or ill
Rippled like a song
And wavy was forever"
Frank Boeijen,Avond,,,"Street barking dogs
Before night falls
I'm hungry and get drunk
In an unfamiliar city
This cafe is open day and night
That says a woman next to me
The story of her life
Similar to yours
She looks like you
And here goes the devil's drink
Take her to the promised land
Rent a room with flowers on the wallpaper
Don Quixote is Don Juan
Don Quixote is Don Juan
I suggest to eat
Somewhere in Ghent
We walk on the cobbles
Let me forget who I am
Across the city hangs this dark silence
That might suit us
And to table singing a singer
A reminder
A memory
Later, an open door is smashed
The hotel room with flowers on the wallpaper
The reward for a desperate man
Don Quixote is Don Juan
Don Quixote is Don Juan
The reward for a desperate man
Is this the reward
For a desperate man"
Frank Boeijen,De Ontmoeting,,,"Come on let's go
The bottle is empty
I'll take you home
It's safe

We have talked
After all this time
We have laughed
for errors
How it would have gone
Now it's too late

But your face
And your mouth
It is so familiar
It is unbearable
That distance
I would love
With you
Oh dear

It makes no sense
To stand still
At what happened
Do not you think

What more can I do
What more can you do
Then proceed
Continue to live
With this reminder
this madness
Come and do not stay
I let you go

But your face
And your mouth
It is so familiar
It is unbearable
That distance
I would love
With you
Oh dear

your arms
And your eyes
It is so familiar
It is unbearable
That distance
I would love
With you

Frank Boeijen,Twee Mannen Zo Stil,,,"Two men so quiet
Hand in hand
At a funeral
From a friend
Give a handkerchief
Tell anyone
A lake of tears
Displaces time
What is grief
Is it an enemy or a friend
Come let's dance
To not go
Until the dawn
Two men so quiet
Hand in hand
Saying goodbye
From a friend
They storm the heavens
They disappear into the night
They flee and they drink
They laugh at the impotence
What is grief
Is it an enemy or a friend
Come let's dance
To not go
Until the dawn
Two men so quiet"

You still had that guy
Who had conquered me?
You were the hunter, I price
Yet you did not have enough to me
I do not need you
No, do not sit hope
You're not exactly where I'm going
What I do and let

[Pre-Chorus]
How you walk, rolled up your sleeves
Can not forget you
Anyway have you out of my head
And out of my life

[Chorus]
You called, I came
I gave, you took 't all
You begs again for a new beginning
But baby it makes no sense
I know I bitch
But what pulls you is not normal
You begs again for a new beginning
But baby it makes no sense

[Verse 2]
I was your girl?
In my memory you keep
Keep you the man I
Myself could
It's finally over
And you must promise me
Do not come after me
It's too late

How you walk, rolled up your sleeves
Can not forget you
Anyway have you out of my head
And out of my life

Roxeanne Hazes,Judaskus,,,"[Verse 1]
Your lips on my mouth
But I'm totally numb
I taste salty tears on my tongue
And your words haunting my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you love me, you trust me
Without a doubt in your voice
What have I done? Let myself go
No idea who I am
All I wanted was to be with you
But I think only of him, ooh

I betray you with a Judas kiss
And leave our bed while you sleep
And I know I'll miss tomorrow
But I'm just too far gone

Tu-du-du
Tu-du-du-du

Your eyes in my back
But I'm all for him
Too late, because I can no longer return
Even though I hear again and again voting

That you love me, you trust me
And know me like no other
What have I done? Let myself go
But I know who I am again
All I wanted was to be with you
So what I do now with him? Ooh

And leave our bed while you sleep

Roxeanne Hazes,Terug,,,"[Verse 1]
When you left, I knew
It's better for both of us
I did my thing, you did your thing
So it might just not be
Everything we then laughed
Whether it was nothing, now hurts so much
And the emptiness, you should know
Is much larger than it should have been
So I ask you now

[Chorus]
Come back in my life
Before you forget who I was
I hate it when you say
I now share the bed with another
It looks nothing like you
It strikes me as against
How does it feel here alone at night
So now I ask you again?

[Verse 2]
All silence in the room
Any questions you no longer wish
Every week, every day
All the hours I now no longer count
And if I had known then
How does it feel to be alone
Oh, I can not forget you
So I beg you, come back
Back to me, come back to me

[Chorus]
Come back in my life
Before you forget who I was
I hate it when you say
I now share the bed with another
It looks nothing like you
It strikes me as against
How does it feel here alone at night
So now I ask you again?
Come back to me"

I looked into his eyes and quickly around me
He had been waiting here, I knew right away
Already four years ago, they did not see me
Had avoided me well because it was not

[Chorus: together]
What if I say I still love you
Is it too late now to regret and remorse?
This is much shorter than eternal fidelity
Now that separates death us again

[Verse 2:
Thijs Beans
 & Roxanne Hazes]
Oh, you still never know in life how it goes
I only know it was not me promise
Oh, he reached for his pocket and pointed at me
He said: ""Rox, I'm sorry,"" when it was over

What if I say I still love you
Is it too late now to regret and remorse?
This is much shorter than eternal fidelity
Now that separates death us again

You can hate me, behind my back talk
I am who I am
I remain nevertheless stand, yeah wen rd but at
Because I am who I am
They hate you and me
I have very much trouble myself
I fought too long
To those who expect a lot more than I can give
They talk about you and me
And think they know who we are
'T Reminds me anything

[Pre-Chorus]
I set up a mask
So I go through life
So no one knows me
""I pray given up

I'll stay standing, yes, but wen d r to
Because I am who I am
Often unloved but unamortized
No, no, oh no
'T Reminds me anything
No, no, oh no

[Verse 2]
Often misunderstood but as it 's life
It is what it is
I laugh of sadness but'm telling you not
Ah, it's what it is
They talk about you and me
Way too many people who understand not really what I mean
Therefore, I find it difficult to just talk about my feelings
They hate you and me
And think they know who we are
It does me nothing

I set up a mask
So I go through life
So no one knows me

With a smile and a tear
I think back to when, 'k see us stand
You looked at me, and you said
""Hey you come over here with me""
You kissed me, long and soft
And I do remember that I thought
That love was hard to find
It was a good moment, quite unexpectedly
And yes, I've often thought back
How you have loved me when

[Chorus]
Because so far I saw love
Only in my dreams
But it was nevertheless finally come my way
It appeared just all so much closer
Will never forget
Because all of a sudden, there was you
Yeah, you
you

'K was happy but never complete
And now they do, ""k hope you know it
By that smile and your beautiful skin
I look my eyes out every day
And oh, the memories of when
'K Would it exactly as redoing

Because so far I saw love
Only in my dreams
But it was nevertheless finally come my way
It appeared just all so much closer
""I'll never forget it
Because all of a sudden, there was you

Dear to me
Gray clouds disappear
Since then I follow where you go
My heart had never been allowed to shine
You have shown me that it all exists

Yes so far I saw love
Only in my dreams

It appeared just all so much closer

Rotating around its own axis

Black is the sky
You make me
A curse and a sigh
In something I do not want to be

To merge under

So I keep quiet and listen to 't black and white
I feel the sun from the past
Where I played carefree childhood
is the night
Bright and clear as glass
And think back to when everything was brilliant

God I miss myself in everything I do
And I want it back but do not know how

Black is the sky
Because you make me
A curse and a sigh
In something I do not want to be

Always on my side

Your first smile, the first step
It seems like it was yesterday
I let you go, for the first time only
So many things go through me
And even though the distance is large
No sea was too rough and way too high

[Chorus 1]
Because when I look at you
I see myself in you
My dear son, you do not know
How much I love you
With both eyes closed
I kiss your head
'K Feel rich now here still lies with me

And what I said sometimes
Or what I did
'T Did you ever upset
I ask only that you never forget
My heart already then so did
It was not always meant
And I hope that you've felt safe

Because when I look at you
I see myself in you
My dear, you do not know
How much I love you
With both eyes closed
I grab you firmly

Far away from you, follow your heart
I will miss you
A new start, you soon

And nobody does what it is you promised
I love you believe it until you
How much I love you
If it is night and the air draws close
Let me see you in full light
If I kiss the tears from your face
How much I love you
I know you can not believe
That there is an end to the pain
But as a flame but could not extinguish
I'm there, and I will always be there
If you think no one really knows you
And you never get used to this world
I hold you until you recognize
How much I love you
I know you can not believe
That there is an end to the pain
But as a flame but could not extinguish

Ilse de Lange,Alles komt in orde,,,
Davina Michelle,Duurt te lang,?,,"[Verse 1]
We could talk about anything, everything
But everything was about love, we forgot everything
In a letter, a text message, a song I wrote
I will do anything for you and for your love I live
And the love I received, and often about degree
You could of life to leave me the thresholds
You saw those girls hate because I had my superhero
You had your friends just often told me about
Now we gaze together to the table with mouths shut
Cans speak naturally in our face
I've done most of all
But I go too long in this tunnel, and I see no light
So close your eyes for our last set
And think back to the little house with the little bed
Shit ... but the pain is back tomorrow
We stand for hours at the station the train ride back

[Chorus]
It takes too long
We are here for a while
And we must excuse me through so for the last time
It takes too long
It takes too long
We stand still
What do you want, what I want
It takes too long

[Verse 2]
Two silent people at the table it is not a face
I can not walked that route with my eyes closed
You know exactly what I'm going to say, 'k know you too
And in the end tell me how many I love you
And then hit the door again and again breaks a glass
Then again there is a tear, and I pick up my bag again
And then .. I love you again firmly
And put my clothes back in the closet
So I hold you for a while because you still remember how angry you were
But the pain remains seated so it does not help
So probably it is the same song again tomorrow
The text is the same in the same beat
A kind of gold paint on a block grief
Conflicts are normal but it should not stifle us
My tears do not fall so I let the song sobbing

[Chorus]
It takes too long
We are here for a while
And we must excuse me through so for the last time
It takes too long
It takes too long
(We stop)
(What do you want, what I want)
It takes too long"

I want your love in black and white
I want more certainty than this
Cause you're my jealous possession

[Chorus]
There is no banger heart, no heart more frightened than mine
'T can not go otherwise it will still against me
Then grab you, saying, ""Have it your way - right now it's over!""
No banger heart than mine
Bang, bang heart, bang, bang heart

[Verse 2]
I you rather than my own dear life
I love to eat, drink as much as you
There is only one thing I do not really have in hand
There is no banger heart than mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I want your love in black and white
I want more certainty than this
Cause you're my jealous possession

[Chorus]
There is no banger heart, no heart more frightened than mine
'T can not go otherwise it will still against me
Then grab you, saying, ""Have it your way - right now it's over!""
No banger heart than mine
Bang, bang heart, bang, bang heart
Bang, bang heart, not fearful heart than mine
No banger heart than mine

[Verse 3]
But if you're scared or lonely
I am a different person instantly
I wrap my arms around you
And you can comfort like no
Comfort like no one!
There is no stronger heart, a stronger heart than mine
When you are low, I'm high enough for both
What do you want, I'm your man turns to me and everything
I can not, let 's just hit that frightened heart of me
There is no stronger heart, a stronger heart than mine
When you are low, I'm high enough for both
What do you want, I'm your man turns to me and everything
I can not, let 's just hit that frightened heart of me
There is no stronger heart, a stronger heart than mine
When you are low, I'm high enough for both
What do you want, I'm your man turns to me and everything
I can not, let 's just hit that frightened heart of me"
Rob de Nijs,Malle Babbe,,,"[Verse 1]
You froth off the streets
And follows the trail of thieves
With beggars and soldiers
Their hats in one ear
You raise your skirts
And smiles to every man
Those in the dark dares
What can not daytime

[Pre-Hook]
And at night
The pubs here
Is your name in the round
When foaming beer blond

[Verse 2]
I know them one by one
The men of decency
I will never forget them
As you do it
How often do you have such a head
Drunk, stupid and horny
Not printed on your chest
Your body is wet from its drool

[Pre-Hook]
And at night
The pubs here
Is your name in the round
When foaming beer blond

[Chorus]
Malle Babbe bowl
Malle Babbe come here
Nice piece, silly girl
Tasty animal fun
Malle Babbe around
Malle Babbe is blond
A kiss on the mouth
Malle Babbe, your fine ass

[Verse 3]
And Sundays in church
Then there is such a gentleman
Stiff as a wooden plank
With nails in his head
To look at his bank
A black linen suit
In order to be wicked body
Afraid of the Devil
And afraid of bitch
And saving a penny
In doing the pouch
He redeems his soul again
And decency
And you should back
In the dark somewhere stand
As it should
But even then the day
They ring the bell
You wear white flowers
And ribbons to your skirt
When we together
Arm in arm go church
What will they look
I always think

[Pre-Hook]
And at night
The pubs here
Is your name in the round
When foaming beer blond

[Chorus]
Malle Babbe bowl
Malle Babbe come here
Nice piece, silly girl
Tasty animal fun
Malle Babbe around
Malle Babbe is blond
A kiss on the mouth
Malle Babbe, your fine ass"
Maaike Ouboter,Dat Ik Je Mis,,,"[Verse 1]
You kiss me, you soothes me
Embracing me, comforting me
You catch me, wants me
Infinite ontbangt me
You call me, you hear me
You save and upsets me
Believe me, rob me
Suffocated and stun me
You live and breathe me
Trembles and shakes me
Trust me, sees me
As a human being and keeps me
Bozige of dreams
Those coming days
Lone questions
End of happiness

[Verse 2]
With your curls as night
How do you talk how you smile
How do you vote so close
If an angel mitigated
flowing in my dreams
infinite emptiness
You inhibits me, you tame me
You stirs and moves me
I miss you, I miss you
I grab you, you I gris
I want you, do you play
I commend you and stir
To stay with me
In dark nights
In order not to languish
To you

[Verse 3]
Let me go
I now only
And hold me when needed
In my mind and I'm looking for you
In everything around me
But I think sometimes
That it is so better
I can not help it
I sometimes miss

[Verse 4]
Oh I choke you, froze you
Deliver and lost your
Way to another place
But I hear you
Embrace you, warm you
I see and I feel
I caress you, I caress you
I hug and cuddle you
You drive me understand me
Confuses and misleads me
It scares me sometimes
What I your body now
My smile my tears
My love, my experience
I'm sorry about everything
Come and help me free
And let me go
I can only
But hold me when needed
In my mind and I find you
In everything around me
But I think sometimes
That it is so better
I can not help it
I sometimes miss

On my snow white humor
""I pray my hands on your hips
But my head is at the door
They say you get used to
I've tried it
But how 't even turn or time
My house does not protect more

[Chorus]
It's raining harder than I can
Harder than I can drink
It's raining more heavily than the ground
Harder than I can handle

[Verse 2]
You are the rain clouds
On my blue mood
I got my hands on your hips
But my head is at the door
Your eyes are gray
Deny any color
It's like nobody lives here
As if nothing happens

[Chorus]
It's raining harder than I can
Harder than I can drink
It's raining more heavily than the ground
Harder than I can handle

[Verse 3]
Your tempers are too dark
For my blue mood
For my head is in the clouds
And my hand already on the door

Harder than I can handle
Harder than I can drink
It's raining more heavily than the ground
Harder than I can handle

It's raining harder than I can
Harder than I can drink
It's raining more heavily than the ground
Harder than I can handle"
BLØF,Wat Zou Je Doen,,,"What would you do if I suddenly stood here for you
What would you do if I was here for you on the ground
What would you do, if I did
What would you do, as I took my hands in your face again
What would you do if I came close to yours with my mouth
What would you do if I did (Well?)
Would you laugh, you would scold
Would you say I'm an asshole
Would you cry, you would swear
Would you say you do not know me anymore
Would you laugh, you would scold, grief
What would you say if I told you about all this time
What would you say if I said I have all this time really no regrets
What would you say, what would you do, if I did
Would you laugh, you would scold
Would you say I'm an asshole
Would you cry, you would swear
Would you say you do not know me anymore

De Dijk,Als Ze Er Niet is,,,"Ten to one I keep my mouth
If I see you again
I know myself as negotiated
I'm not a talker
How was it here
Will ask
And I will say
Good
But I tell you what I think now
That I should really say

A man does not know what he's missing
Do not know what he's missing
Do not know what he's missing
A man does not know what he's missing
But if she is not there
If she is not there
Know a man until he misses

You talk endlessly about how it was
About how you've had
And maybe if I'm floating
Say sometime treasure
Then you ask me
How was it with you
At most, I say
Quiet
And I'm not saying you again what I think now
I can finally say would

A man does not know what he's missing
Do not know what he's missing
Do not know what he's missing
A man does not know what he's missing
But if she is not there
If she is not there

Only now you're not here
Now I feel it in me
Now you do not hear me
I feel it word for word
Preface

A man does not know what he's missing
Do not know what he's missing
Do not know what he's missing
A man does not know what he's missing
But if she is not there
If she is not there
Know a man until he misses"
De Poema's,Houten Hart,,,"[Verse 1]
My heart is not made of stone
A case of pure wood
It was the best I could find
Then someone went away with the gold
My heart is the hardest wood
But it still bends as it should
But not too far and easy
I'm not really sure what it does

[Chorus]
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies you have already weighted
So do love
It will not hurt
And not steal seems worthwhile

[Verse 2]
You may well run
Then it does not hurt so much
As when I had the original yet
Gold, gold but small
This heart, I bought it only
Knowingly used
You still do not buy gold
Even if you had the chance

[Chorus]
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies you have already weighted
So do love
It will not hurt
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies you have already weighted
So do love
It will not hurt
And not steal seems worthwhile

[Bridge]
The advantage of a wooden heart
You are careful with fire
The splinters to others
There does not lock and is not expensive
My wooden heart
My wooden heart

[Chorus]
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies you have already weighted
So do love
It will not hurt
This is my heart
My wooden heart
The ladies you have already weighted
So do love
It will not hurt

[Outro]
This is my heart
My wooden heart
This is my heart
My wooden heart
This is my heart
My wooden heart
This is my heart
My wooden heart"
De Poema's,Zij Maakt Het Verschil,,,"She is no cure for the ticking of the clock
No hope, no guide
No port in the night
No spring in the desert
If you are going to destroy the thirst
Not the smile on your worst joke

She is not hitrefrein
That the scaffolding sounds
Not the most expensive wine
You drink without a hangover
No flower in bloom
Not one in a thousand nights
No outstretched hand
Not the end of all my waiting

No, even more that I really would like to admit
It makes the difference

She's not lame excuse for what I'd like to be
Not a dream, not a goal
No stick to beat them to
No guarantee of a long happy life
She does not answer the question of our existence
Not the most beautiful symphony under the film called the two of us
Not the clean cool bed that can take away my fevers

Not the beat of my heart
Not the cleanest conscience
They did not come at the right time
And it does not matter to me
Because even more than I really would like to admit
It makes the difference

Between everything I had, and how it suddenly went live
What is sketched with pencil
Colors can be subscribed
Between never anything going on and a lot to do
Between never and maybe rarely
Between me and us

So many singers, many words
And it has all been said
But what they try
No comparison is justified
Maybe it's something simple
But all I want to hear
It makes the difference
It makes the difference

Because she is not a conversation that no dog is waiting
Not the flag under which I struggle
No advice for all my complaints
Not the last way in which we have long no longer thought
But even more than I really would like to admit
It makes the difference
It makes the difference"
De Poema's,Zitten voor de blues,,,"I already know what's coming
And my God, what is it hard
It's really unstoppable
Sand in my heart
Tonight I sit
And do all the wrong things
Drink me all to pieces
To sing the blues

It seems to mostly as doing well
It seems to usually after intoxication
At each beginning of every success
Scours the sand of old blues
It's too big a sum
Of pain over months
Much too long walked
Too long and only

So I'm going
Sitting for the blues
Sand in my heart
I must die, but not die
Twice as hard
Sand in my heart

And then I'm going to sit again
And then I'm going to make it
With lots of booze and dead pictures
And just bad singing songs
And drink but for those tears
Which for too long have waited
I need to drown the pain
It's now or never tonight

So I'm going
Sitting for the blues
Sand in my heart
I must die, but not die
Twice as hard
Sand in my heart"
Acda & de Munnik,Niet of nooit geweest,,,"I see two people on the beach
Close to the water, hand in hand
The sun sinks, they speak of happiness
I know its just because it's you
She smiles at him, he looks like me
But you can not, because I make every piece
I can still never be that guy?
That peace, that love, not for me
But why does it seem so familiar?
I love you, as you can see
But something's wrong here, something not
I wear a ring, but ... ""I never married you ...
I'm not myself
Or all those years never
I'm the pacemaker at the wrong party
I'm not myself or never
I'm not myself or never
I see two people, they stand
She turns around, we have to go
Look into my eyes and see the same pain
Two people already connected
All that love, what a sin
We are both just do not want to be
I'm not myself
Or all those years never
I'm using the wrong
is reading
I'm not myself or never
I'm not myself or never
Oh, let it be the sun (let it be the sun)
Oh, let it be the beach
Let the sea
Let me do something now
So you never want to see me
O, let it be the salt is (let it be the salt)
Let it be my dumbest mistake
But never let me forget it
Never forget again
Let me never forget this, moreover
I myself am not sure all those years never
I myself am not sure all those years never
I'm not myself or never
I'm not myself or never
I am not or have never been myself. (I'm not myself, if ever, been all these years)
I'm not never been myself. (I'm not myself, if ever, been all these years)"
Acda & de Munnik,Waar was je dan,,,"Where were you? by Acda and De Munnik
Where were you
When I called you
You told later
It was with friends in town
D'There was some
A party and there would you have been
What did you do
When you heard me
I bothered
In your butterfly in the night game
You said quietly: ""Do not, sleep now '
And a kiss
And I know I will not claim
No problems would make
If it was difficult
And I know I would let
You would never leave me
Never
But it was difficult
So was difficult
Who the hell ever expected
But where you were then
When I waited for your anticipated in my bed
I had put the alarm clock
Because you would surely come
But what took you so long
What took you so long
What took you so long
I'm going to play here
And I wait
And you laugh but
Everything good
Everything good
I'm here
I'm still with you
And we make love
Everything good
But where were you
When I kissed you
You jaded eyes
Your sweaty cheeks kissed softly
I do not know what you thought
But what I do now
And I can not much longer
Love sweet love
Where are you (3x)
Where, where are you
Where are you then
True"
Racoon,Het is al laat toch,,,"[Verse 1]
What an idea, a plan, oh fuck man
Why am I so nervous
Go inside, go sit down and have a drink then
Maybe she thinks you like
And you know her, so together and you can laugh a little there
There is always a choice
She looks at you
The atmosphere is suddenly so serious

[Chorus]
It's getting late anyway
It's getting late anyway
What we do here
It's getting late anyway
It's getting late anyway
Do you want beer yet
Come let's go to my house

[Verse 2]
I do not know, it was so beautiful, not normal anymore, all
What time can still easily break
The whole life of the shovel, looking for a dream story
And I look, and feel bad
I lost it, or did I leave anything lying somewhere over
Tell me anywhere
We grow as far as you can call it that
We grow apart

[Chorus]
It's getting late anyway
It's getting late anyway
What we do here
It's getting late anyway
It's getting late anyway
You stay here
I'm already home

[Bridge]
Now the door is closed cases
Your presence disappears
Is my world just smaller
Soul only by stubbornness
What we forget the rebuke
The grind of many years
We complain that we piss
But in the same language

[Chorus]
It's getting late anyway
It's getting late anyway
What we do here
Come let's go to my house

It's getting late anyway
It's getting late anyway
What we do here
It's getting late anyway
It's getting late anyway
So drink your beer
And then we go to our home"

An ocean in order to flee
Never having to be jealous
Love to your heart airing
an ocean
How nice would it be

Was there something I wanted to
Before the well was running dry
Then it was long they will live
Family that I love so much
And for whom I die

[Bridge]
An ocean to shelter in
Never having to be alone more
I begged not to cry
Please
Life hunts no fear anymore
I have so far to crawl
The last part will also go
Until I stand

An ocean in order to flee
Never having to be jealous
Love to your heart airing
an ocean
Just mine

An ocean to drown
A day or so to be a hero
Let the other person but now crawling
an ocean
Tears are mine
Just mine"
Boudewijn de Groot,Avond,,,"[Fresh]
Now you never have your coat more to attract
And hope that makes you light it
Leave out the storm but now raging in the dark
Because inside it is warm and bright and well
Hand in hand look outside where the rain falls
I see the fire of hope and doubt in your eyes
And I know your deepest fear

[Chorus]
Because you can not know for sure and everything passes
But I believe [5x]
In you and me

[Fresh]
And when you get up in the morning I'm with you
And maybe I've put tea
And when the sun is shining outside we walk through the dunes
And if it rains we t'rug in bed
Hours slowly waking up, floating through time
I see the light through the curtains
And I know, it does not guarantee past

[Chorus]
Because you can not know for sure and everything passes
But I believe [5x]
In you and me
I believe [5x]
In you and me

[Fresh]
I turn off the lights and the room is dark now
A streetlight outside gives some light
And the things in the room are friends who go to sleep
The chairs await 't breakfast
And tomorrow I wake up to the smell of bread and honey
The luster of golden sunlight in your hair
And the things in the room, I tell them goodnight
Tonight we go to sleep and tomorrow we'll see
But things in the room were lifeless things, without you

[Chorus]
Because you can not know for sure and everything passes
But I believe [5x]
In you and me
I believe [5x]
In you and me
Because you can not know for sure and everything passes
But I believe [5x]
In you and me

Boudewijn de Groot,De vlinder,,,"So to die on the water with your wings of paper
Just float, after flying in the clouds drift here
With your colors fade
Without search without asking
At last forever rest
And the flowers that you kissed
Gleuren you knew
Everything you can now forget
On the water you cradle back and forth
So to die on the water with your wings of paper

If a butterfly can still fly into the blue sky
If a butterfly always free and for life on the run
I want to die on the water
But that is a concern for later
I would now like butterfly flying
The flowers, flying blisters
But so high I can not come
So I fly only in my dreams
I'm always for life on the run
If a butterfly can still fly into the blue sky

For I thought life would be a butterfly
To fly very far away from all life and all pain
But I no longer affected by jealousy of a butterfly
If even butterflies to die I will not spoil my joy
I can live without flying
What I would give even more
To a butterfly is drowned in me
I need to live more truly to be a butterfly"
Jan Smit,Ik zing dit lied voor jou alleen,,,"On 'told one day, my dear grandmother

For her last journey
In one very beautiful paradise

When I arrive there
Sing your song for you then me
Because I do not feel so alone
I sing this song for you alone
Bring white roses for you along
Oh dear grandmother, where 'k love
It's so lonely here without you
I sing this song for you again and again
And dry my tears every time
Oh dear grandmother, ""k love you
Yours, yours
stay with grandma at home with all my friends
What was it 's nice time
We played Scrabble and Yahtzee
And my grandmother always did it
And we sang the most beautiful songs
That grandmother knew of yore
But her beautiful voice is not anymore
I sing this song for you alone
Bring white roses for you along

A cyclist who turns the corner

That money for you but for me ...

Oh let the sun in your heart
They still shines for everyone
Enjoy life
Because it takes anyway here
Oh ate the sun in your heart
They still shines for everyone

Because it takes anyway here

The beach, the sea, the full moon
The sky where the stars are

And you sometimes benevolent
Remember the smile of a child
Yeah that makes jeweer happy so that makes you happy again
Life goes by so fast
That money for you but for me ...

Fall for my part all dead
I do not want to learn good boy
I end anyway in the gutter
Children do not play with me
They call me rat and point me after
The only one that I care
That never, that's my dad

My mother can not bear me
I never do anything for her well
To love I do not even ask
Swearing is everything she does
No wonder my dad is going to sail
I could not count, I'm too small
I need to get myself
Until he will ever be back

I wish I had someone to love
Two soft arms around me
Which would always protect me
I feel so damned alone

Maybe if fathers ship is
As he returns from the sea
Says ""he's still es: listen Cis
Why do not you go with me?
Yet I am still just a kid
Can not alone
Maybe I'll ever find happiness
But how, that's a big problem

Paul de Leeuw,Ik heb je lief,,,"K do not know if you're waiting
A friendly word from me
If I call you in mind
Makes me happy that many bits
'K feel it when I see you sitting
If I only smell
'T is in one hundred thousand butterflies
That sweet floating in my belly
'K love you my life
It's much more than love
It's like sitting in my blood
I can not live without you
Your beautiful eyes make me melt
Put me so ablaze
I feel it just in your sight
I get it Rotterdam
'K love you,' k love you, 'k love you
What should I do without you
'T be four tiny words
And if it makes you a little scared
'K love you, four seasons long
'K feel it very often when you rise
Or after a summer storm
I'm all week at the thought
You're walking in my favorite sweater
It's my hand that you suddenly grabs
If I dollig bike next to you
'T is also, which is now the mad
Even with nothing
'K love you,' k love you, 'k love you
What should I do without you
'T be four tiny words
And if it makes you a little scared
I love you, fourteen flower's long
I taste it during our kissing
Or if you suddenly laughs
I see it in shooting stars
After vigorous intercourse in the night
'T is the tingling in that breeze
Does your all to myself
I think when I see you like walking
God, there is an angel over
'K love you, I love you, I love you
What should I do without you
'T be four tiny words
And if it makes you a little scared
I love you, a thousand and one nights long
One of my most beautiful dreams
Is grow old with his two
But that may come from
I love you even after retirement
I love you
What should I do without you
'T be four tiny words
And if it makes you a little scared
I love you, four hundred Christmas trees tall
I love you, 'k love you
My whole life long"
Marco Borsato,Waarom nou jij,,,"If someone left me
One swallow and move again
Even tossing and just get up again
It reminded me much

But to you I'm sad
Without you terribly void
Your voice remains in my head
Me no moment alone late

And there are people who laugh
And there are people dancing
And that there are people who intimately kissing
I can no longer understand

I only feel the pain of God, where is she? '
I only feel the pain of yours here with me miss
And I can not handle it
I really can not handle it

And I would like to beg
You on my knees to beg
If I knew it still had meaning
But the days, weeks and weeks to years

This fight I can not win
Because you sit too deep inside
Well why you, why you now?
Why you?

Why are you here in my life?
Why are you doing not go?
Why do you wish me to give anything more?
Why are you leaving without reason?

I hold you in my mind
I see how you laughed at me
I miss your lips on mine
An image that will never disappear
Your hand no longer mine

So I count the empty long days
Those without passing you
With no hope for tomorrow
No hope whatever

But you
You sometimes think of me?
Am I a bit with you?

'K Just count the long days
'K Just count the empty long days
But I do not want to
I do not want anymore

If someone left me
One swallow and move again
Even tossing and just get up again
It reminded me much

But to you I'm sad
Without you terribly void
Your voice remains in my head
Me no moment alone late

And there are people who laugh
And there are people dancing
And that there are people who intimately kissing
I can no longer understand

I only feel the pain of God, where is she? '
I only feel the pain of yours here with me miss
And I can not handle it
I really can not handle it

Nanana ..."
Borsato,Afscheid nemen bestaat niet,,,"[Lyrics from ""Goodbye Is Not""]

[Verse 1]
Saying goodbye does not exist
I'll go away, but will not leave you
My dear, you must believe me, if it hurts
I want you to let me go
And tomorrow you go again
But if you're lonely or scared
I'll be there

[Chorus]
Come as the wind and feel the rain
Follow what you do when the light of the moon
Find me in everything you come to me
Whisper my name and I will be

[Verse 2]
See what is invisible, what you believe is true
Open your eyes and I'll be with you
All you have to do is believe me on my word
Saying goodbye does not exist

[Chorus]
Come as the wind and feel the rain
Follow what you do when the light of the moon
Find me in everything you come to me
Whisper my name and I will be

[Bridge]
Look at the sky, look at the sea
Where you will walk, yes, I'll walk with you
Each step every moment,
Where you go
Ey-yeah-yeah-yeah
Whatever you do, wherever you go
If you need me, just whisper my name
And here I come

[Outro]
Saying goodbye does not exist"
Volumia!,Hou Me Vast,,,"Nobody knows why the day is night again
Nobody knows why the sun still shines
Nobody knows why the chilly winds still blow it
But I know that I love you

Nobody knows why falling stars
Nobody knows why death follows us
No one knows why people sleep in the cold
But I know that I love you

Hold me, put my head on your shoulder sweet
Hold me, caress me gently through my hair
Hold me, sometimes it's all too briefly
And be with you, is all I want

No one knows why some lucky blows away
No one knows why a flower wilts
Nobody knows why you're the only one I trust
But I know that I love you

Hold me, put my head on your shoulder sweet
Hold me, caress me gently through my hair
Hold me, sometimes it's all too briefly
And be with you is all I want

Ask me anything, tell me nothing, save your arms around me
Do not talk to me, hold me tight
Words still fail as I pour out my heart to you
Do not talk to me, hold me tight

Hold me, put my head on your shoulder sweet
Hold me, caress me gently through my hair
Hold me, sometimes it's all too briefly
And be with you is all I want"
Volumia!,Afscheid,,,"Always close to each other
My arms around you
My greatest love
I knew it right away
The last weeks, the days went fast
Close by is the farewell
It is sometimes difficult

Say you do not have to go treasure
You really had enough of me
Say you do not have to go treasure
Go baby, because you have
I know you have

If at all possible, then I stayed another night with you
If at all possible, then I stayed another night with you
I would say I'm waiting for you
And that the future for our laughs
I would say for the umpteenth time
I do not want another never

The bags are already outside
The rear door slams
One last kiss
In the early morning light
You look at me sweetly
And grabs me tightly
I whisper in your ear that I remember

Say you do not have to go treasure
You really had enough of me
Say you do not have to go treasure
Go baby because you need
I know you have

If at all possible, then I stayed another night with you
If at all possible, then I stayed another night with you
I would say I'm waiting for you
And that the future for our laughs
I would say for the umpteenth time
I do not want another never

Never again will I feel what I feel for you
I hope I can live without you
Come and go now, wipe your tears away, and remember very well
I love you, love you

NO NO NO; you do not go treasure, NO!
NO NO NO, you do not go treasure, NO!"
